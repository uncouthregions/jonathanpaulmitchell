I work as a philosopher and critical disability theorist. Until recently, I was an [Irish Research Council Government of Ireland Postgraduate Scholar](https://research.ie/) in the [School of Philosophy](https://www.ucd.ie/philosophy/) at University College Dublin.

My research falls within the tradition of critical disability studies, and also draws upon feminist philosophy, twentieth-century continental philosophy, biophilosophy, and philosophy of technology. It examines the relationship between disability and abiding ideas of humanity and the human; the role played by disability in the stabilisation of ideas about what is properly or essentially human; and the limiting and harmful effects on disabled people.

As it stands, this website is mostly a place where I share drafts from conference and workshop presentations. You can read these by tapping ['Updates'](/posts/). Some drafts contain ideas that I was developing at the time, but do not wholeheartedly subscribe to any longer. Please consider more recent work to be most indicative of my current positions.

You can find me on [Mastodon](rel="me" href="https://zirk.us/@jpmitchell"), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/UncouthRegions/), [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jonathan-Mitchell-4), and [ORCiD](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4107-7453).
