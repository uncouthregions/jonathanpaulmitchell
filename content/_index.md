I'm a philosopher and critical disability theorist. Until recently, I was an [Irish Research Council Government of Ireland Postgraduate Scholar](https://research.ie/) in the [School of Philosophy](https://www.ucd.ie/philosophy/) at University College Dublin.

I work in the tradition of critical disability studies, and draw upon feminist philosophy, continental philosophy, and actor network-theory. I'm interested in the reality of disability, and how it happens: as a concrete and practical experience, as a category or identity, and as a purported deviation from the proerly human. I'm also developing an ethical approach that avoids the pitfalls of humanism. This is based in feminist theories of vulnerability, and foregrounds the role of biopolitical rationales in the safeguarding of some ways of thinking and acting and the exposure of others to harm. I'm also interested in biopolitical dimensions of responses to COVID-19, the ableist commitments these rely on, and the ableist outcomes they produce.

You can read a bit more about me and my research [here](/about/). As it stands, this website is mostly a place where I share drafts from conference and workshop presentations. You can read these by tapping ['Updates'](/posts/). Some drafts contain ideas that I was developing at the time, but do not wholeheartedly subscribe to any longer. Please consider more recent work to be most indicative of my current positions.
