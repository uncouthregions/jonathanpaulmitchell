I'm a philosopher and critical disability theorist. Until recently, I was an [Irish Research Council Government of Ireland Postgraduate Scholar](https://research.ie/) in the [School of Philosophy](https://www.ucd.ie/philosophy/) at University College Dublin. I'm currently working towards monograph publication. I'm interested in the reality of disability, and draw upon feminist philosophy, continental philosophy, and actor-network theory to understand how it happens: as a concrete and practical experience, as a category or identity, and as a purported deviation from the fully or properly human. I'm also developing an ethical approach that avoids the shortcomings of humanist approaches where disability is concerned. This is based in feminist theories of vulnerability, and conceptualises this as ubiquitous, but as always and everywhere realised in concrete conditions. It foregrounds how some are safeguarded and others exposed to harm according to biopolitical rationales. I'm also interested in biopolitical dimensions of COVID-19 responses, the ableist commitments these rely on, and the unjust outcomes they produce.

You can read more about me and my research [here](/about). As it stands, this website is mostly somewhere to share conference and workshop papers. You can read these by tapping ['Updates'](/posts/). Some drafts contain ideas that I was developing at the time, but do not wholeheartedly subscribe to any longer. More recent works are most indicative of my current positions.
