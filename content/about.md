I was an Irish Research Council Government of Ireland Postgraduate Scholar in the School of Philosophy at University College Dublin.

My research falls within the tradition of critical disability studies, and also draws upon feminist philosophy, twentieth-century continental philosophy, biophilosophy, and philosophy of technology. It examines the relationship between disability and the human, and the role played by disability in practices that stabilise ideas of what is properly or essentially human.

As it stands, this website is mostly a place where I share drafts from conference and workshop presentations. Some drafts contain ideas that I was developing at the time, but do not wholeheartedly subscribe to any longer. Please consider more recent work to be most indicative of my current positions.

You can find me on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jonathan-Mitchell-4) and [ORCiD](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4107-7453).
