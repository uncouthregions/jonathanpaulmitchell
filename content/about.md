Welcome to my website.

Iâ€™m a recently minted doctor of philosophy. I was an Irish Research Council Government of Ireland Postgraduate Scholar in the University College Dublin School of Philosophy.

My research falls within the tradition of critical disability studies, and also draws upon feminist philosophy, twentieth-century continental philosophy, philosophy of biology, and philosophy of technology. It examines the relationship between disability and the human, and the role played by disability in practices that stabilise ideas of what is properly or essentially human.

As it stands, this website is simply a place where I will share some unpolished drafts from conference and workshop presentations.
