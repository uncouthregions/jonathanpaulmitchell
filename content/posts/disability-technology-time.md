The main content of this paper is published as "[Unsafe Ground: Technology, Habit, and the Enactment of Disability](https://tidsskrift.dk/KKF/article/view/127873)". *Women, Gender & Research* 31, no. 2 (2021): 24--39.

I'm going to talk here about very basic kinds of technology, and how these contribute to the enaction of disability. I will first sketch some commonplaces concerning the body and technology, before outlining my own position on these: that the body has a fundamental relationality, of which technology, broadly construed, comprises one aspect. Then I'll outline something called *inter-mundane technology* (a low level artefactuality that supports activity while falling outside awareness, so that its contribution goes unacknowledged and the activity appears natural); and the *technological unconscious* (a corpus of habituated expectations about how the world is). Finally, I'll discuss how norms materialised in inter-mundane technologies lead to one way disability gets enacted, which us erosion of bodily confidence in the world.
