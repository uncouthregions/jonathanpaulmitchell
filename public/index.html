					<time>Dec 16, 2021</time>
					<br><div class="description">
						
						Presented at &lsquo;Invited Speaker Seminar Series&rsquo;, Nordic Network Gender Body Health / Imagining Technologies for Disability Futures 16 December 2021. This is a work in progress and not for citation.
Disability is a consistent topic of concern within philosophical ethics (including medical and applied ethics, and bioethics). In many cases, however, it is viewed as a misfortune, and an impediment to well-being. This is because matters of the good human life turn on some criterion&mdash;rational autonomy, say, or personhood&mdash;that distinguishes good from bad lives.&hellip;

						Presented at ‘The Inhuman Gaze and Perceiving Otherwise’, Centre Culturel Irlandais, Paris, France, 6-9 June 2018. This is a work in progress and not for citation.
A final version of this paper is published as “Disability and the Inhuman”, in Perception and the Inhuman Gaze: Perspectives from Philosophy, Phenomenology and the Sciences, edited by Anya Daly, James Jardine, Fred Cummins, and Dermot Moran, 298-307. London: Routledge, 2020.
When presented with the term &lsquo;inhuman&rsquo;, I was drawn to consider how certain ways of existing come to be considered as not fully human, and associated with something inhuman; how such associations are in fact involved in the constitution of what is taken to be fully or properly human; and finally, the deleterious effects for those who, because they move or think in unconventional ways, become associated with the inhuman.&hellip;

					<time>May 23, 2018</time>
					<br><div class="description">
						
						In their arguments against repeal of the 8th Amendment of the Irish Constitution, the No campaign has used Down syndrome to suggest that this Amendment is necessary to protect disability rights. It isn’t.
First, the Love Both campaign website notes that government proposals contain no explicit ban upon abortion on grounds of disability diagnosis. It infers from this that “babies with disabilities” and “babies with Down syndrome” are placed at “serious risk” (I won’t say much about this rhetorical strategy that conflates foetus with baby or child besides noting that a foetus is neither, and that you can read more about that here).&hellip;

						Presented at Nordic Network Gender Body Health conference &lsquo;Disability, Arts and Health&rsquo;, Bergen University, Bergen, 1-2 September 2016.
Not for citation.
Introduction Technologies are not mere external utilities, but are profoundly involved within human development. Explanation of such involvement takes various forms. Like natural and social artefacts, technologies have a historical development, and can acquire metaphysical baggage (Hui 2016). One way to conceptualise technology is in terms of prosthesis: a tool&mdash;from a flint or a hammer, to language&mdash;that extends or enables capacities.&hellip;
