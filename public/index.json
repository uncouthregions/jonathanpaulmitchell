This is a work in progress and not for citation.\nDisability is a consistent topic of concern within philosophical ethics (including medical and applied ethics, and bioethics). In many cases, however, it is viewed as a misfortune, and an impediment to well-being. This is because matters of the good human life turn on some criterion\u0026mdash;rational autonomy, say, or personhood\u0026mdash;that distinguishes good from bad lives. These specify certain properties or capacities that are purported to be essential to humans, and for a good life. Disability here figures not only as an impediment to the capacity to realise the goods that attend a fully human life, but as a lack of some fundamentally human capacity. There is no shortage of arguments by influential thinkers concerning the moral permissibility of eliminating disabled people, based on the idea that the latter are not fully human in some meaningful respect.\nMy aim is to develop some aspects of a critical orientation that does not rely upon definitively human capacities, and that, as such, does not exclude atypical bodies and minds from the outset. To explore such ideas, I consider feminist theories that understand vulnerability to be a ubiquitous or even universal aspect of life, and as such, as a more appropriate basis for ethics. I suggest that instead of understanding vulnerability in either universalistic or particularistic terms, these two aspects can fruitfully be integrated. Vulnerability is an ineluctable dimension of embodied existence; however, it is always and everywhere produced and experienced in concrete conditions. Significantly, vulnerability is unequally distributed: the vulnerability of some lives is safeguarded while that of others is exposed. I suggest that this provides a fruitful way to understand disability, without appealing to essentialist notions of the human: the potential vulnerabilities of some bodies are neglected in social and material situations, such that disability is actualised as a result. I finally suggest an approach for identifying and responding to vulnerability that is not grounded on any specific criterion of the human, and that involves a collective commitment to continually compose better relations.\n","date":"16 December 2021","permalink":"/posts/disability-personhood-vulnerability/","section":"Posts","summary":"Presented at \u0026lsquo;Invited Speaker Seminar Series\u0026rsquo;, Nordic Network Gender Body Health / Imagining Technologies for Disability Futures 16 December 2021.

It isn’t.\nFirst, the Love Both campaign website notes that government proposals contain no explicit ban upon abortion on grounds of disability diagnosis. It infers from this that “babies with disabilities” and “babies with Down syndrome” are placed at “serious risk” (I won’t say much about this rhetorical strategy that conflates foetus with baby or child besides noting that a foetus is neither, and that you can read more about that here). While it is true that the government proposal requires no additional justifications for termination, this is only during the first twelve weeks. While someone could seek abortion on grounds of Down syndrome during this period in principle, they could almost certainly not do so in fact. According to the Royal College of Physicians, the point at which tests can be conducted, and the time taken to receive results, together make it “virtually impossible” to diagnose Down syndrome within this 12 week window. After 12 weeks, abortion can take place only where there is significant risk to the woman’s health, or where the foetus is determined to be non-viable. Hence there can not be abortion after 12 weeks on grounds of Down syndrome or many other irregularities (unlike in the UK, where a 24 week window means that test results can be acquired in time). By leaving this out, Love Both implies — or to be charitable, fails to correct the assumption — that Down syndrome diagnosis is enough to justify abortion under more relaxed conditions (perhaps up to the 6 month threshold that has been discussed inaccurately). In sum, this major wing of the No campaign suggests that repeal and government proposals will make it very easy to abort ‘babies’ with Down syndrome. It won’t.\nSecond, despite current Constitutional conditions, abortions are already taking place. This means that women presumably are seeking abortions on the grounds of Down syndrome and other foetal irregularities. They are simply doing so outside Ireland. This suggests that maintenance of the 8th will not prohibit abortion on the grounds of Down syndrome or other disability. Worse still, this existing state of affairs makes it difficult to reckon with the matter of abortion in response to disability, since this issue is parcelled up with the more general culture of secrecy and shame that currently surrounds abortion in Ireland. Furthermore, that abortions on such grounds will continue even if the 8th is maintained returns us to more general arguments in favour of repeal (these have been covered in many places, and I won’t rehearse them here).\nThird, Love Both suggests that 8th is only bulwark protecting the lives of Down syndrome babies from the widespread abortion seen in other European nations. This tracks a general No strategy: that without the 8th there will be widespread destruction of life (where life is conflated with personhood). This makes it seem as though repeal will inevitably cause abortions, and that disability diagnosis will almost certainly lead to abortion (Love Both responds to claims that screening can’t reliably diagnose Down syndrome during the first trimester by stating that “many women won’t wait for further diagnostic testing”; that is, they will go straight to abortion). One reason this is important is that it sidelines the fact that where abortions are sought, actual Irish people — women, partners, parents, friends — will deliberate about, advise on, and ultimately take, the ethical decisions about whether or not to seek abortion. Furthermore, it implies that women receiving Down syndrome diagnoses will always abort if that option is available. That is, it obscures the autonomy of those most directly affected by the situation in question. It is true that some will decide to have abortions. Some will opt otherwise. These decisions will be based on different ethical frameworks, on counselling, upon whether or not families are able to support a child; whether or not abortion is, in their circumstances, the right option.\nThis argument — that, as Love Both say, the 8th is essential for “protecting and valuing the rights of people with disabilities” — is also significant because it tries to yoke abortion to disability rights by making prohibition of the former and protection of the latter seem like two sides of the same coin. Relaxed abortion law will infringe upon disability rights; protection of disability rights requires that the Amendment be maintained. However, this connection between availability of abortion and likelihood of abortion in cases of foetal irregularity is neither necessary nor inevitable. The right to abortion and disability rights are separate issues, and should be decoupled. It is not inconsistent to support access to abortion and to take issue with abortion on grounds of disability.\nThis is because negative assessments about disability are a problem of society at large, not a problem with abortion as such. Ableism— the idea that it is bad, pitiful, or shameful, to have a body or mind that works in unusual ways — is knitted into the fabric of daily life. Material environments, social norms, cultural products: are all imbued with ideas about which kinds of lives are more or less valuable. Where such ideas are taken for granted, how could they not inform decisions about abortion? There may indeed be high rates of abortion for reasons of Down syndrome in the UK, Denmark, and Iceland. First, these are matters of empirical fact, not inevitable entailments of the availability of abortion. And importantly, they have more to do with wider attitudes about disability than they have to do with the availability of abortion. This is because availability of abortion does not directly cause abortion on the basis of disability. Ableism, by contrast, is likely to be a proximal cause of abortion on the grounds of disability.\nWhile I am somewhat less sanguine then Together For Yes when they say that “[w]hatever a woman decides, it will be a considered and thoughtful decision taking into account the well-being of her family”, this is not because I don’t trust women, or because I am worried about the availability of abortion, but because ableism is pervasive. However this does not justify restriction of bodily autonomy. We can support autonomy while working to eliminate ableist prejudices. This latter activity will enrich deliberative resources available to those deciding whether or not to carry a foetus to term; and it can improve support for families with disabled members, thereby to improve the lives of those that do choose to have a child.\nUltimately, safeguards upon the lives of disabled people do not entail a corresponding restriction of the bodily autonomy of Irish women.\n","date":"23 May 2018","permalink":"/posts/8th-amendment-disability-rights/","section":"Posts","summary":"In their arguments against repeal of the 8th Amendment of the Irish Constitution, the No campaign has used Down syndrome to suggest that this Amendment is necessary to protect disability rights.

This is a work in progress and not for citation.\nThe main content of this paper is published as \u0026ldquo;Unsafe Ground: Technology, Habit, and the Enactment of Disability\u0026rdquo;. Women, Gender \u0026amp; Research 31, no. 2 (2021): 24\u0026ndash;39.\nIntroduction I\u0026rsquo;m going to talk here about very basic kinds of technology, and how these contribute to the enaction of disability. I will first sketch some commonplaces concerning the body and technology, before outlining my own position on these: that the body has a fundamental relationality, of which technology, broadly construed, comprises one aspect. Then I\u0026rsquo;ll outline something called inter-mundane technology (a low level artefactuality that supports activity while falling outside awareness, so that its contribution goes unacknowledged and the activity appears natural); and the technological unconscious (a corpus of habituated expectations about how the world is). Finally, I\u0026rsquo;ll discuss how norms materialised in inter-mundane technologies lead to one way disability gets enacted, which us erosion of bodily confidence in the world.\n1. Objective Embodiment and Instrumental Technology I\u0026rsquo;ll initially sketch models of the body and of technology to which I\u0026rsquo;m opposed. Since we\u0026rsquo;re all probably familiar with this account of embodiment, I\u0026rsquo;ll deal with it quickly to spend more time on technology. This model of the body is\u0026mdash;unsurprisingly\u0026mdash;one that takes this as a mere object: something like a brute biological fact. Here, the body possesses clear boundaries, and can be described exhaustively and accurately from a scientific standpoint. As self-identical and adequate to itself, it requires nothing more to be what it is. It is the realisation of its genetic blueprint, itself produced by natural forces. Any subsequent modification does not change its essence. It is separate from subjectivity or personhood. Its past and present effectively coincide: its biological causal history defines what it is, once and for all. Finally, it is a neutral substratum. Whatever is thought about, or indeed as, a body, its biological basis is unaffected. Put otherwise, from this perspective, relations, temporality, and normativity, are inessential to the body.\nThis fundamentally misconceives some aspects that are characteristic of organisms as such, never mind complex organisms, or those that engage in tool use. Accordingly, I propose an account based in a more phenomenological model of a living body that is a locus of pragmatic action: an \u0026lsquo;organ\u0026rsquo; of movement and connection, both within, and opening onto, the world (Merleau-Ponty 2012). This is grounded in the primacy of movement, which is, in simple terms, transition towards or away from something to which the body attributes positive or negative value. The three aspects that an objective model of embodiment considers inessential\u0026mdash;relationality, temporality and normativity\u0026mdash;are instead fundamental and constitutive dimensions of living bodies. Relationality means that, as active, a body is continually drawn outside itself and into relations with other things. A living body does not terminate at the dermal boundary: it exists through relations with its milieu. This also involves temporality: as always acting beyond itself, a body is primordially orientated towards the future. Every situation the body enters into is simultaneously \u0026ldquo;its own range of possible appearances and actions\u0026rdquo; (Hoel and Carusi 2015: 78). A living body is never definitively here or now. It is always outside and ahead of itself: \u0026ldquo;never wholly within one specifiable locus [and is] always already on the way to somewhere else\u0026rdquo; (McCumber 2016: 201). As for normativity, living beings do not apprehend the world as bare objects, but as situations laced with meaning according to value or potential for embodied activity. A perceiver does not simply see a chair with a particular set of determinable properties, but as within or beyond reach, as comfortable looking, as available for this or that activity. This is not judgement made about prior perceptual experience, but is basic to perceptual experience (Romdenh-Romluc 2007). In sum, a living body is always disposed towards some activity in the world, through which activity it produces itself.\nFor human animals, a preeminent aspect of this relationality involves technology.1 Technologies, however, are more usually understood as external tools. I\u0026rsquo;ll quickly outline this instrumentalist understanding, and several ontological presuppositions that flow from its oppositions between natural and artificial, human and nonhuman (Latour 1993). A first premise of instrumentalism is the principle of externality. This means that technologies are fully exterior to the human. They are mere means, awaiting use towards human ends; ends that are formulated autonomously, separately and in advance of tool use (Aristotle 2008). Technologies are epistemically and morally neutral, or at the very least, \u0026ldquo;subservient to values established in other… spheres\u0026rdquo; (Feenberg 2002: 5). Second is the principle of essentialism. If technology is external and neutral, whatever it permits merely augments or reflects preexisting and essential capacities or values. This not only presumes pre-technological human capacities and values, but that there is such a thing as \u0026lsquo;human\u0026rsquo; prior to technology. Third is the principle of autonomy. Humans are autonomous subjects for whom technologies are objects that are means of extending freedom. Freedom as such requires\u0026mdash;in principle, if not always in fact\u0026mdash;no additional material for its exercise. Technologies extend human freedom that passes through these while leaving no trace. Overall, technology has no profound status with human existence (it only contributes secondarily, as an extension of something that comprehensively pre-exists technology), and has no enduring effect upon the human as an entity or category.\n2. An Alternative Account of Body and Technology So, a common way of comprehending this relation is that technology is separate from and dependent upon the human. Technology describes so many neutral objects used by humans towards autonomous goals. Of course, there are other ways to understand the human-technology relation. I suggested that living bodies exist through active, constitutive relations with their milieu. This human milieu is technological. The human is a technical animal, where technics refers less to technological objects, and more to a constitutive relation of embodied activity with external things, through which extra-organismic materials get profoundly incorporated within perception and action.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll briefly mention two approaches with which I broadly agree. The first posits technologies that are internal to perceptual experience or embodied activity. Unlike instrumentalism\u0026mdash;wherein artefacts merely expedite or extend preexistent capacities\u0026mdash;here the technological contribution is substantive. Artefacts may be involved in perception, to co-constitute modes of world disclosure; or within bodily activity to be at least partially-responsible for availability and exercise of such actions. Consider Merleau-Ponty\u0026rsquo;s (2012) oft-cited description of the non-visual man who incorporates his cane within bodily intentionality, such that this technology is not external, but one point of sensitivity among others. For more quotidian instances, consider eyeglasses, microscopes, hammers, and telephones (Ihde 1990). In each case, artefacts are significant for, or internal to, the activity: without them the action would be different, even impossible.\nThat such contributions become familiar, and that artefacts no longer feel external, is thanks to the role of habit in embodied encounters the world. Merleau-Ponty (2012) highlights what he calls \u0026lsquo;body schema\u0026rsquo;: a compound of sedimented corporeal dispositions, that continually conveys an implicit and immediate practical sense of the relationship between the body and its surroundings, including what actions that relationship affords. This is thanks to the fact that, first, the body schema involves what Don Ihde calls a \u0026ldquo;polymorphous sense of bodily extension\u0026rdquo; (1990: 74): its scope is unfixed, and can expand and contract relative to what technological relations are embodied. This allows technologies to mediate and transform a body\u0026rsquo;s perception of and action in its world, while awareness of that body and technology alike withdraws into the experiential background: focus goes \u0026rsquo;through\u0026rsquo; these to the activity their coupling enables. I propose that this can be pressed further still. Thought and action not only overspill the somatic boundaries of the body. The activity in question emerges within, and supervenes upon, the dynamic processes of interaction between bodies and environments (Protevi 2014). The activity is located precisely in or as the relation, not in the things that are in relation.\nA second way to understand the human-technology relation involves the technological genesis of the human as such. This is the claim that human and technology develop together, as seen in Bernard Stiegler\u0026rsquo;s (1998) proposition that the human has an \u0026rsquo;epiphylogenesis\u0026rsquo;: technology is essential to the human, which has always incorporated extrinsic materials, and develops itself through externalisation in technical artefacts. However minimally, all activity has some technological dimension: whether proximal (like previous examples wherein some artefact\u0026mdash;a cane, a notebook, glasses\u0026mdash;is incorporated within bodily comportment to enable or transform action and cognition), or distal (the deep historical provenance of technologies that structures present activities). This definition of technology is very broad, and involves very basic and mundane instances. Here, technology describes any product of techne: the activity by which living beings modify the world which, for Stiegler, is to incorporate external materials within activity. This tendency to self-exteriorisation, composition and assemblage makes the human essentially undetermined, or more correctly, progressively determined through its creative engagement with artefacts. Its \u0026rsquo;nature\u0026rsquo; is, as Joanna Zylinska sees it, to negotiate human-nonhuman boundaries via \u0026ldquo;a long line of technical prostheses such as flint stones and other \u0026lsquo;memory devices\u0026rsquo; that have played an active role in the very process of the constitution of the human\u0026rdquo; (2010, p. PG).\nA brief point of qualification: I\u0026rsquo;m not suggesting that this makes the elaboration of the human a reciprocal relation between two kinds of object, one bodily, the other technological. Living beings exist in heterogeneous ensembles of relations with other bodies, other organisms, practices and knowledges, and so on, none of which enjoys absolute ontological or explanatory priority (Latour 1999). The salience and effects of any one interactant\u0026mdash;even one so apparently foundational as organismic structure\u0026mdash;is a function of its interactions with every other. Before such relations, a body\u0026rsquo;s status is potential. Potential gets actualised through entry into relations. How it gets actualised depends upon the relations entered. Nevertheless, I\u0026rsquo;m suggesting that such ensembles do typically have a persistent technological dimension, insofar as bodies are perpetually in relation with situations whose arrangement is worked over by human activity.\n3. Inter-Mundane Technology and Disability I\u0026rsquo;ll now discuss two concepts\u0026mdash;a mode of technology, and a disposition towards technology\u0026mdash;that together contribute to one way that disability happens. I\u0026rsquo;ll call the mode inter-mundane technology. By this, I mean something similar to what Ihde (1990) calls \u0026lsquo;background relations\u0026rsquo;. Earlier I discussed his \u0026rsquo;embodiment relations\u0026rsquo;: those relations with tools that become so incorporated through familiarity that they withdraw into the background of awareness during the activity they allow. During looking or hammering, focus isn\u0026rsquo;t upon eyeglasses or hammer, but what is seen or hit. Background relations, by contrast, fall even farther outside attention. These concern technologies that operate as fully withdrawn. Ihde discusses such pervasive technological scaffolds as shelter technology, traffic control systems, automatic and semiautomatic household appliances, lighting and temperature systems. These are fully present to consciousness as absent, because they manifest as part of the environment (into which they disappear). They invisibly accompany and support humans as they traverse the world, and structure the world in important ways without drawing attention to themselves.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll modify Ihde\u0026rsquo;s definition somewhat. By inter-mundane technology I mean, first, anything artefactual that generally does not signal itself as such. Activities in which these are involved can be complex or simple. Walking usually involves technology. A pathway is just as much a technology\u0026mdash;for expediting travel, demarcating territory, domesticating \u0026lsquo;wilderness\u0026rsquo;, modifying spatio-temporal relations\u0026mdash;as is a stone adze or a smartphone. It is a human modification of the world whose contribution to ambulation typically goes undiscerned. Besides surfaces, we could think of internal dimensions of everyday and domestic spaces, distances between buildings in public space, lighting and shade, gradients, and associated temporal implications. Inter-mundane technologies, then, fall somewhere between technical artefact and environmental feature. They are one concrete dimension of the relations into which bodies enter when traversing environments.2\nA second aspect concerns how these technologies are\u0026mdash;ostensibly\u0026mdash;not designed for specific bodies, but are supposed to befit the body of a universal or generic human. It\u0026rsquo;s just this aspect that I dispute. This brings us to ability and disability. First, I\u0026rsquo;ll note that for my approach, much that seems natural and spontaneous involves a technologically-scaffolded dimension. Any apparently spontaneous use of tools is a function not only of the body, but of relations with an available and sympathetic milieu. If activity is a function of relations, this implies the ubiquity of a composite or distributed agency, and that the notion of a fully autonomous human\u0026mdash;with its ideal \u0026lsquo;ability\u0026rsquo;\u0026mdash;is somewhat spurious (Introna 2014). Fully context-transcendent ability would imply an originary, self-sufficient, complete human, as though in the state of nature, a condition representing \u0026ldquo;the absence of relation\u0026rdquo; (Stiegler 1998: 128).\nHowever, it\u0026rsquo;s inadequate to settle for the claim that \u0026lsquo;all bodies are technologically-enabled\u0026rsquo;. While humans and technologies may indeed develop together, this development has been partial and uneven. Existing sites for activity are grounded on a long ontogenetic history of body-technology interactions: practices that have harmonised relations between bodies and things. Atypical bodies have scarcely been considered during the elaboration of these technologies that afford the bulk of what are now characteristically human activities. The artefacts involved in embodiment relations\u0026mdash;all the tools that are picked up, put on, sat upon and within, during everyday activities\u0026mdash;are materialisations of value that avail themselves only to certain kinds of body. Inter-mundane technologies likewise presuppose certain bodily arrangements, capacities, and competencies, thereby creating an asymmetry in how such background environments afford activity. Contexts delimit in advance which activities are available, which bodies are assigned value.\nThis disjuncture brings into being one aspect of disability. Strictly speaking, disability does not reduce to physical properties, but comes into being within relations. It is not intrinsic to an atypical body that it cannot act in a certain milieu; rather, that historically elaborated milieu accommodates only typical bodies. This does not deny that ability has degrees, only that it is specifiable independent of context and activity. There is no disability antecedent of situation, only disabling and enabling relations. This makes occurrence not merely spatial but temporal. In a time-worn example, a wheelchair-user only becomes disabled when acting within unsympathetically organised space. I don\u0026rsquo;t mean by there is a naturally impaired body\u0026mdash;here, that of a wheelchair-user\u0026mdash;that is a natural fact prior to entry into social space. I take the insights of actor-network theory to mean that all bodies exist at the intersection of myriad heterogeneous relations, and have no nature that pre-exists and abides unchanged through these relations (Mol 2002; Moser 2006). For the \u0026lsquo;disabled person\u0026rsquo; those interacting dimensions include DNA, phenotype, law, discourse, science, medicine, spatial arrangements, technologies. That disability does not correlate with biology does not entail that phenotype is irrelevant. Phenotype can play a role, but rarely is there\u0026mdash;nor need there be\u0026mdash;an inevitable correlation with certain effects (Saldanha 2006). Just as with typical, normatively-endorsed bodies, its reality is produced in relations with other dimensions.\n4. The Role of the Technological Unconscious This general incongruity between atypical bodies and mundane space is one aspect of what I\u0026rsquo;m calling unsafe ground. The other concerns the role within activity of expectation about technical milieus. Here I\u0026rsquo;ll discuss habituation in terms of an embodied dimension that Nigel Thrift (2004, p. PG), citing Patricia Ticiento Clough, calls the \u0026rsquo;technological unconscious\u0026rsquo;: a \u0026ldquo;prepersonal substrate of guaranteed correlations, assured encounters, and therefore unconsidered anticipations\u0026rdquo;. Following repeated correlations, positionings and juxtapositionings within technological spaces that presuppose particular competencies, bodies amass sedimented dispositions and comportments. These comportments, then, acquire a sort of \u0026lsquo;harmony\u0026rsquo; with normatively-organised technological environments, that register as \u0026ldquo;spaces of anticipation\u0026rdquo; standing ready to accept action (Thrift 2004: 175). With time, these relations\u0026mdash;with objects, situations, routes\u0026mdash;acquire an ontological fixity and pseudo-naturalness: expectation that spaces will reliably afford activity hardens into \u0026rsquo;the way things are\u0026rsquo;. Crucially, since this involves prepersonal bodily dispositions, it includes a felt sense that bodies and things have correct and incorrect postures, positions and dispositions. Purportedly natural space gets freighted with a deep affective sense of right- and wrongness. This is ramified by the fact that technological relations already tend to withdraw from awareness when things are working, allowing technological contributions to remain tacit (Latour 1999). This is especially pointed with inter-mundane forms.\nTypical bodies\u0026mdash;that are also normatively-endorsed in the general scheme of things\u0026mdash;not only benefit from environments tailored to their capacities. Habitually encountered space seems, if not necessarily homely, at least familiar or unchallenging. Body, world, and the relations that occur between these, can be forgotten. This allows for formation of durable habitual relations, and in turn, unquestioned anticipations and an associated sense of confidence and ease in the world at large. Indeed, technologies can only contribute to activity and withdraw from awareness if they accord with the body in question. When things go smoothly\u0026mdash;when there is a fit between bodies and inter-mundane space\u0026mdash;prepersonal expectations are fulfilled, the semblance of naturalness is achieved, and conventional aspects do not surface.\nDisability has such a temporal aspect: it is implicated within future-orientation. Norms laid down in the artefactuality of the world\u0026mdash;including, as we have seen, those that presuppose typical embodiment\u0026mdash;structure how possibility shows up, and thereby contribute to the basic structure of tracing out possibilities for action. Lived space is apprehended as eliciting certain actions; inter-mundane situations are saturated with norms concerning \u0026lsquo;what everyone does\u0026rsquo;. The atypical body is in the midst of a world traced out by potential it cannot actualise, or where its comportment to some extent mis-matches context. Disjuncture arises between possibility and actuality, intention and realisation. Or, by contrast, the very lack of affordances might be recognised, leading to hesitation.\nThis means that where typical bodies for the most part enjoy implicit support, and can have unquestioned confidence about relations with the world (without recognising relations as relations), for atypical bodies the incongruence between embodiment and spatial organisation makes it difficult for the habituating capacities of the body to find purchase. Consequently, the relation of body and space cannot be so easily forgotten: a permanent question hangs over the reliability of relations. This can freight the future with a negative ambiguity. This is all the more pertinent if, as I maintain, possibility comprises a substantive aspect of existence. If temporal passage is characterised as having a world through experience of significant possibilities and meaningful change, this very structure may be modified. Lost confidence attenuates anticipatory structure: the sense of possibility\u0026mdash;potential to imagine otherwise, to conceive of oneself doing otherwise\u0026mdash;is dampened. Where a sense of possibility is attenuated, intentional threads connecting anticipation to what Ratcliffe et al. (2014) name \u0026rsquo;teleological time\u0026rsquo;\u0026mdash;directedness toward more remote but not necessarily less-determinate goals\u0026mdash;are slackened. Instead of a future of significant possibility, there is one where possibilities are curbed.\n5. (In)visibilisation The contributions of technological auxiliaries can become invisible not only because of the capacity of bodies to \u0026lsquo;absorb\u0026rsquo; tools within them, but because those tools are made to afford that absorption. This upshot is that the fulfilment of the prepersonal expectations of typical bodies conceals the underlying contingency of the relations that ensure such fulfilment. This reinforces the sense that the actions of typical bodies are spontaneous and free: that such capacities are inherent property of their body, and that the environment in which they act is a passive and neutral scene. By contrast, when atypical bodies produce mis-fit or disharmony, and inter-mundane space is taken as a lifeless background, it seems as though that disharmony flows fully from the atypical body. That body is made visible as the locus of the problem (where that locus is really the relations between body and extra-somatic factors). What is crucial here is that although they are contingent and conventional, inter-mundane technology and technological unconscious convey a sense of inevitability. This very mundanity make the activities they support seem all the more natural, but this also means that the basic relationality and contribution of technologies gets elided. Indeed, this is one way that disability\u0026rsquo;s very heterogeneity\u0026mdash;that it has multiple, relational determinants\u0026mdash;gets simplified and reduced. It is transformed back into seemingly objective and natural somatic properties.3\nConcluding Remarks By contrast, all activity involves relations. If living is the movement of bodily self-transcendence\u0026mdash;a body not something one has, but does\u0026mdash;then whatever contributes to that activity is, for the duration of the relation, a part of that living being. This is just as true of intra-mundane components as of more conspicuous prosthetics. Indeed, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure there is any difference in kind between embodied technologies, and those that are not. Intra-mundane technologies form a persistent dimension of the activity of moving bodies. This means that for atypical bodies, one aspect of their being\u0026mdash;that contributes to self-constitution or ontogenesis\u0026mdash;is consistently unsympathetic. This ungrounds anticipation and attenuates or delimits potential. Importantly, since much of this occurs at a prepersonal level, it is felt more than known. It is the sense of felt possibilities relative to the body, but where only the body, and not its relations, are recognised as their source. It is a constant affective dampener on embodied potential. Moreover, since each interactant in an ensemble of relations affects the contribution of every other, this dampening can inflect how other relations manifest. Unsafe ground might interact with somatic dimensions (environs condition how phenotype manifests: what one can physically do, how much fatigue should be expected); with dispositions (how open one is to the unexpected, to risk); with discourses (how willing one is to accept diagnosis, or identify as disabled). Of course, these are all in constant, mutually-conditioning interaction. While I am cautiously optimistic about possibilities that technological developments afford to atypical bodies, much outstanding metaphysical baggage must get cleared out on the way, if this is not to impede our ability to imagine other ways of living. A central aspect of this stocktaking is a rejection of the spurious self-aggrandisement of the unattached and unimpeded human subject, in favour of a relational thinking that highlights not just the presence of enabling milieus, but how the shape of those milieus entails an unequal distribution of capacities for activity.\nWorks Cited Aristotle (2008), Physics, Oxford World\u0026rsquo;s Classics, tran.

Explanation of such involvement takes various forms. Like natural and social artefacts, technologies have a historical development, and can acquire metaphysical baggage (Hui 2016). One way to conceptualise technology is in terms of prosthesis: a tool\u0026mdash;from a flint or a hammer, to language\u0026mdash;that extends or enables capacities. I\u0026rsquo;ll discuss prosthesis as a human-technology relation, and consider three such conceptualisations\u0026mdash;instrumentalism, Bernard Stiegler\u0026rsquo;s originary technicity, and Gilbert Simondon\u0026rsquo;s concretisation\u0026mdash;and discuss their relevance to and potential for thinking about disability.\nEarly Theories of Technology # In Technology and the Character of Contemporary Life, Albert Borgmann suggests that early understandings of technology take one of two forms: instrumentalism and substantivism. In instrumentalism\u0026mdash;which is ubiquitous\u0026mdash;technologies are thought of simply as tools; mere means awaiting use towards autonomously-formulated human ends (Aristotle 2008). They are epistemically and ethically neutral, or \u0026ldquo;subservient to values established in other… spheres\u0026rdquo; (Feenberg 2002). Instrumentalism is broadly optimistic: technologies are means towards human freedom. Substantivism, by contrast, tends towards a pessimistic articulation of technology (Ellul 1964; Heidegger 2013; Horkheimer and Adorno 2007). Here, technology is no mere means, but an autonomous force that distorts or replaces other values, and comes to determine human behaviour. This follows from its underlying, instrumental logic, which engenders an objectivising disposition towards others and world\u0026mdash;as mere manipulable resources\u0026mdash;that alienates humans from their non-technological nature.\nDifferences notwithstanding, these share a cluster of related ontological presuppositions that flow from oppositions between natural and artificial, human and nonhuman (Latour 1993). I\u0026rsquo;ll concentrate on instrumentalism, and briefly mention three. The first is most fundamental: the principle of essentialism. This supposes that there exists some specification of what the human is, which properties it possesses. Second, the principle of autonomy. This posits an exclusively human property that is fundamental to definition of the human, that requires\u0026mdash;in principle, if not always in fact\u0026mdash;no additional material for its exercise. Humans are essentially autonomous subjects for whom technological objects are mere means: these extend a freedom that passes through them while leaving no trace. Finally, the principle of externality. This human is defined only by reference to itself, to its own capacities or properties. While technology can only be defined by reference to the human, it is entirely external to the essence of the human. Technology is just something\u0026mdash;albeit something highly significant\u0026mdash;that humans use to realise their ends. I\u0026rsquo;ll call this position\u0026mdash;that betrays a clear humanist bent\u0026mdash;\u0026lsquo;weak prosthesis\u0026rsquo;; weak, because technology makes no profound contribution to, and has no enduring effect upon, the essence of the human. This position includes any technological intervention that purports to extend or restore human properties, where this is not understood as a concomitant modification of the human itself.\nInstrumentalism and Disability # I\u0026rsquo;ll turn now to disability, and how this separation between human essence and technology plays out in the concept of normal function. Medical accounts often consider disability an individual problem occasioned by a dysfunctional bodily property. In Christopher Boorse\u0026rsquo;s \u0026rsquo;normal function\u0026rsquo; concept, the \u0026ldquo;normal is the natural\u0026rdquo;, while diseases are \u0026ldquo;foreign to the nature of the species\u0026rdquo; (1977: 554). Humans who are unable to perform what he counts as normal activities\u0026mdash;speaking, walking\u0026mdash;are deemed dysfunctional. Impairment essentially and directly correlates with a reduction in health, and warrants correction or rehabilitation. Some medical ethicists adopt this as a regulatory standard (Buchanan et al. 2000). Here biological deviation from normal function\u0026mdash;which is taken as an objective fact about humans\u0026mdash;correlates with decreased social opportunity as a \u0026rsquo;normal competitor\u0026rsquo;, or decreased quality of life. Only those who see, walk, talk, access \u0026ldquo;the \u0026rsquo;normal opportunity range\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; (Amundson 2000: 46). Accordingly, medicine and technology can help by restoring normal function.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t mean to suggest that such interventions are always negative, or to discount positive reports by those using prosthetics or undergoing interventions that replicate functional and aesthetic norms. My concern is with technology and its role in the production of the human. I\u0026rsquo;m suggesting that weak prosthesis does more than it admits. The implied boundary between human and technology obscures their myriad interleavings. It stabilises across time the organising concept of a human essence whose autonomy correlates with morphological properties. Its purported neutrality obfuscates this productive role. This occurs in different technological registers: from the operative idea of \u0026lsquo;restoration\u0026rsquo; for those with congenital impairments, to instruments that monitor for foetal \u0026lsquo;abnormalities\u0026rsquo;, resulting in selective termination. I\u0026rsquo;m not debating the ethics of these practices. I\u0026rsquo;m suggesting that technological intervention reproduces and renegotiates a boundary within the living between normalcy and deviation, and that this boundary is not read off nature, but introduced into it.\nBernard Stiegler and Technicity # Latterly, philosophers of technology have undertaken an ontological reorientation away from dualisms that place human subject over and against technological object, to instead understand humans as profoundly interrelated with technologies. I\u0026rsquo;ll talk now about Bernard Stiegler (1998), then discuss some implications of his position for disability and prosthesis. I\u0026rsquo;ll call his position strong or \u0026lsquo;constitutive\u0026rsquo; prosthesis, because he understands technology as internal to the definition of humanitas. The human is constituted as such technological activity. His argument goes roughly as follows. The human is \u0026lsquo;born too early\u0026rsquo;: it has no inherent capacities, including memory. This susceptibility\u0026mdash;this défaut or lack\u0026mdash;is constitutive and originary: what the human has, essentially, is nothing: its essence is indetermination. It makes technology to mitigate this deficiency. Such supplements as language, sociality, and tools transform environs and ultimately defer death. The human exists as its concurrent externalisation in technical materials, and internalisation of this prosthetic ek-sistence. This is a co-constitution of \u0026lsquo;inside\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;outside\u0026rsquo;, rather than an addition of external technology to the preexisting interior of a human essence: \u0026ldquo;[M]an invents himself in technics by inventing the tool\u0026mdash;by \u0026rsquo;externalising\u0026rsquo; himself techno-logically […] the interior is invented through this movement: it cannot precede it\u0026rdquo; (Stiegler 1998: 141\u0026ndash;42). Finally, this produces a rupture from \u0026lsquo;pure\u0026rsquo; biological life. Technology comprises a new inorganic organisation of memory (Stiegler 1998): human culture made concrete in enduring technical artefacts. Humans, then, have definitively shifted from genetic to non-genetic memory: they are not determined to be what they are by their genetic endowments. They are liberated from genetics, and subject to new, non-biological exigencies, which only increases their indetermination.\nInitially, this looks like a fruitful way to approach disability and prosthesis. If the \u0026lsquo;human condition\u0026rsquo; involves a technological compensation for inherent vulnerability, everyone is lacking and none are complete. Moreover, technics is precisely liberation from biology. Consequently, disability need not identify a categorial division between completeness and insufficiency, between fully and partially human. Finally, technologies need not approximate normal function. However I don\u0026rsquo;t think that we should embrace Stiegler too hastily. This is because, first, he separates biology and technology too forcefully, and does not sufficiently acknowledge relations between bodies and technologies. For him, \u0026lsquo;Man\u0026rsquo; still evolves biologically as an animal, but becomes human only through technical evolution: by using tools to anticipate possibilities other than those proscribed by genetics. Human invention principally concerns a vie d\u0026rsquo;esprit that is not biological, but technically-instantiated. Even though this vie d\u0026rsquo;esprit exists in material technologies, Stiegler skirts close to a technologised variation on mind-body dualism.1 Externalisation in technics is simultaneously internalisation within the human, but only within technical subjectivity. This subjectivity is robustly divided from the biological body\u0026mdash;equated by Stiegler with \u0026lsquo;stupidity\u0026rsquo;[bêtise]\u0026mdash;which makes it difficult to grasp how technology interacts with and affects the body. This problem cannot be overstated, since Stiegler\u0026rsquo;s basic position is that humans exist precisely at their point of separation from biological features. This approaches a denial that biology is an aspect of humanity. It also entails a robust division between nature (locked into evolutionary adaptation and mechanistic repetition) and culture (liberated by technics to radically innovate). This is reminiscent of Sartre\u0026rsquo;s existentialism, that goes even further to effectively deny that the human has biological features (Esposito 2011).\nThis echoes debates in disability studies concerning whether impairment is a biological or social artefact. In Stiegler\u0026rsquo;s account, impairment would reside in the biological register, though it could be radically overcome by technics. This suggests an inability to adequately address a question motivating this paper: what role do technologies already play in disability? Surely biology and technology do not have separate causal histories?2 I\u0026rsquo;ll suggest that the very emergence of disability is enacted in and through relations between bodies and technologies, broadly construed, that regularise valued and disvalued properties.\nA second problem concerns lack: Stiegler rejects a fixed biological nature for an equally universal foundation. It is not insignificant that Stiegler begins from Lacanian premises, which lends his account a psychoanalytic tenor (LaMarre 2012). The human must recognise and reconcile itself to its essentially fragile nature. However, that humans are fragile as a matter of empirical fact doesn\u0026rsquo;t warrant the overdetermination of this characteristic into an ontological ground (Combes 2012). Crucially, taking humans as equally or universally vulnerable engenders a homogeneous conception that flattens out bodily diversity. Put differently, this claim can only find purchase by disregarding embodiment. Even assuming that we accept vulnerability as the human predicament, starting from concrete particular bodies (as does Simondon) would instead suggest heterogeneity, and vulnerability by degrees.\nGilbert Simondon and Individuation # So while Stiegler\u0026rsquo;s originary technicity looked promising, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t address the body\u0026rsquo;s own contingency, and its interrelation with, not transcendence by, technology. I\u0026rsquo;ll turn to Gilbert Simondon\u0026rsquo;s work to this end, before making some suggestions about technology\u0026rsquo;s role in the production of the human. Simondon\u0026rsquo;s organising concept\u0026mdash;individuation\u0026mdash;understands individuals in terms of process and relations. It can be very roughly characterised as follows. The individual can only be understood relative to the preindividual. These two concepts do not identify discrete substances, but two phases in an ongoing process that Simondon calls individuation. Individuals are the products of individuation (though in the case of living individuation, this process is never complete). The preindividual\u0026mdash;perhaps Simondon\u0026rsquo;s signature concept\u0026mdash;is the condition for individuation: a domain or reservoir of potential, \u0026lsquo;prior\u0026rsquo; to structuration as an individual, and out of whose tensions individuals emerge. Individuals are resolutions of tensions with the preindividual field. The preindividual is continually replenished by the process of individuation, and remains primed to engender further transformations. Alongside the individual, individuation also produces a specific associated milieu, to which that individual relates. This relation between individual and milieu is the \u0026rsquo;location\u0026rsquo; of the preindividual. As Pascal Chabot writes, \u0026ldquo;[t]o exist is to be connected\u0026rdquo; (2013: 77). This means that relations are not accidents that affect a pre-given individual. Relations are part of what brings that individual into existence. The individual is not in relation; it is relation. An individual, then, exists as an unfolding trajectory. It is never self-identical or complete, but one phase of a becoming: the temporary crystallisation of a set of preindividual potentials. While there is structure or stability, it is an outcome of \u0026lsquo;underlying\u0026rsquo; operation or process.\nSimondon and Technology # For Simondon, technology is a kind of individuation: a movement from abstract to concrete, called concretisation. The process of invention begins with an end or predictable outcome in mind. Understood thus, an object in its primitive form is abstract: a blueprint describing an assembly of elements, each of which is a \u0026ldquo;closed system\u0026rdquo; with its own discrete structure (Simondon 2012: 21). During their \u0026lsquo;perfection\u0026rsquo;, however, elements take on extra functions that were not anticipated in the original design. The technical object, then, acquires a range that exceeds original intention \u0026ldquo;due to the superabundant efficacy of the created object when it is a true invention\u0026rdquo; (Simondon 1966, 1197). And, it gradually realises relations to an associated milieu. So where the abstract object was entirely artificial\u0026mdash;and identified closely with the inventor\u0026rsquo;s goals\u0026mdash;a concrete object has a mode of existence irreducible to any human artifice or natural law, that \u0026ldquo;approximates the mode of existence of natural objects\u0026rdquo; (Simondon 2012: 46). Consider too how many things called natural are in fact artificial: a cultured flower is the product of human artifice (which would make it unnatural in classical terms), and cannot fruit by itself (Chabot 2013: 17). To simplify: the concrete object has essentially an openness that the abstract object lacked. It is loosened\u0026mdash;albeit not completely\u0026mdash;from human origin and ascribed purpose. Perfection does not instantiate Platonic form: a complete, abstract thing given in one blow. It inaugurates a pattern open to dynamic transformation, an object with a higher degree of openness, a greater \u0026ldquo;margin of indetermination\u0026rdquo; (Simondon 2012: 11). Indeed, it is precisely indeterminacy that becomes concrete: \u0026ldquo;concretisation lies in the solidity of openness\u0026rdquo; (LaMarre 2012: 92).\nRelational Disability # So, the basic insights of Simondon are: the preindividual\u0026mdash;transformative potential\u0026mdash;is primary; this gives both living and technical a fundamentally open, processual character. This is overlooked when attention is restricted to structure, taking this as exhaustive of the individual or object, and ignoring its genetic operations. Sure enough, the modern metaphysical chauvinism towards the self-identical submits such openness to a logic of closure, generating both an anthropocentric view of the human (as self-identical, self-contained and autonomous), and an instrumental view of technology (called the \u0026rsquo;labour paradigm\u0026rsquo;). The latter doesn\u0026rsquo;t only address work, but rather describes a disposition towards technology\u0026mdash;that affects life at all levels and scales\u0026mdash;that ignores its genesis, its human relation, and above all its openness: \u0026ldquo;the inherence [in technicity] of values going beyond utility\u0026rdquo; (Simondon 2012: 222). I\u0026rsquo;ll dwell on this a little before turning to Simondon\u0026rsquo;s positive implications.\nThis closure\u0026mdash;of human and technology within themselves, and from each other\u0026mdash;is surely significant for disability, grounding as it does the abstract autonomy that underpins normal function (and that echoes instrumentalism). This allows humans to understand themselves as fully autonomous even as their actions are technologically-enabled (Latour 1993, 1999). Yet this implies \u0026lsquo;context-transcending abilities\u0026rsquo;, which would in turn suggest a self-sufficient, complete human. As Stiegler rightly suggests, this recalls the state of nature, which would represent \u0026ldquo;the absence of relation\u0026rdquo; (Stiegler 1998: 128).\nInstead I\u0026rsquo;m suggesting that there is a banal, low level prostheticity to the average and everyday. Much apparent complementarity between \u0026rsquo;normal\u0026rsquo; humans and environments is not spontaneous, but the outcome of activities, both historical and contemporary, that render the world thus through harmonisation with a valued functional ideal. Rather than a universally valid\u0026mdash;that is, \u0026rsquo;normal\u0026rsquo;\u0026mdash;mode, there are normalised relations that prioritise certain modes. Importantly, the underlying logic understands these relations as between determinate entities\u0026mdash;the normal individual, the neutral tool\u0026mdash;and remains at the level of structure, without attending to their engendering processes. Rather than ability or disability antecedent of situation, there are enabling and disabling relations. \u0026lsquo;Ability\u0026rsquo; correlates less with innate features, and more with temporally-normalised relations between bodies and a world of technologies (broadly construed) that en-able them. Conversely, disability reduces neither to physical properties nor inherent lack. It is a spatiotemporal event, that occurs where a merely atypical body encounters others with incongruent orientations, where affordances are absent or inapt. Disability and ability are relations between real bodies and technologies, where the contribution of the latter is effaced.\nTransductive Prosthesis and Technical Ethics # Now I\u0026rsquo;ll turn to the affirmative register of Simondon\u0026rsquo;s thought, to make some suggestions for alternative ways to think the human-technology relation, which I\u0026rsquo;ll call transductive prosthesis: transductive because neither participant is entirely the agent, and every individuation is conditioned upon earlier individuations, that conserve their own potential for transformation. While Stiegler is right that technical evolution transforms the human, this is not based in a compensation for vulnerability. There is nothing essentially lacking in humans (or any individual). Muriel Combes (2012: 49) suggests that Simondon proffers a humanism \u0026ldquo;constructed on the ruins of anthropology and on the renunciation of the idea of a nature or human essence\u0026rdquo;. Saying that the essence of the human is that it has no essence, while aporetic, is still a universalising claim. Simondon instead asserts that they are instead characterised by potential to differentiate that is characteristic of the living in general. Humans are but one vector within a continuity of living individuation. Humans and technological objects each contain this potential, essentially but differently.3 There is something human in technology, not because they are makers and users, but because the technical individual is an elaboration of potentialities within humans. Nevertheless, technology is not constitutive in Stiegler\u0026rsquo;s sense: it is merely one\u0026mdash;albeit highly significant\u0026mdash;trajectory of individuation. Technology doesn\u0026rsquo;t stand opposed to the living or compensate for its weaknesses: it ramifies the living. Even though they emerge from human activities, their openness means that technologies retain a kind of quasi-agency that is not parasitic upon humans. The human-technology relation is co-individuation: a \u0026ldquo;dialogue between humans and machines\u0026rdquo; that engages preindividual forces in human and technology that individuate together (LaMarre 2012: 98). Humans are \u0026ldquo;conductors in the world orchestra of technology around them\u0026rdquo;, of which they too are part (Simondon 2012: 11). Simondon will explicitly suggest that the human is not a pre-given set of somatic or cognitive capacities, but a living being that enters into relations with technical objects in an associated milieu. The relation of humans to machines is piecemeal, a pragmatic \u0026ldquo;perpetual invention\u0026rdquo; (Simondon 2012: 12). And technology retroacts upon or loops back into nature. Their inventions transform milieus, which provokes in turn new invention.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll finally make three brief recommendations about disability-technology relations in a Simondonian key. First, taking individuation seriously means resisting closure and teleology in biology and technology alike. Remaining with structure only discloses regularity, and (somewhat) warrants the understanding of humans as (however imperfect) instantiations of ideal form. Instrumental understandings of health and technology leave their categories untouched, and reproduce metaphysical commitments to closure within individuality that occludes the reality and primacy of relation. A related point concerns technical objects. If these have a genesis and lineage that is concurrently implicated in human becoming, we should attend to the anthropocentric\u0026mdash;not merely human\u0026mdash;in prosthesis. I\u0026rsquo;ve already mentioned the reduction of technology to productivity\u0026mdash;due to the longstanding tendency to think the human-technology relation analogically with mastery and bondage\u0026mdash;that short-circuits technology\u0026rsquo;s potential. Perhaps technological solutions for disability implicitly tend towards normalisation not simply because of present economic imperatives, but also because productivity is sedimented within technology\u0026rsquo;s purported role or purpose (Barthélémy 2015).\nThe obverse practice attends to processes of taking-form. Such in-forming is not construction by humans out of passive nonhumanity. Simondon reontologises bodies: not as substances but as real trajectories of becoming. There is an ontology of disability. It is neither biological nor social, but individuated within many, real but contingent, relations that, through repeated practices, acquire an apparent fixity. This fixity might be contested: by recognising \u0026ldquo;technical concretization and the transductive relation between humans and technology\u0026rdquo; (Landes 2014: 169). And by following material processes that affect which bodies inhabit the world: how and why such productions happen, and that it could have been otherwise.\nA final point concerns taking-up of potential towards a more open future. Liberating technology from productivity releases its inventive power. My former references to \u0026rsquo;the human\u0026rsquo; were (hopefully) only pragmatic. I instead advocate a non-anthropocentric theory of technical relations that relinquishes emphasis upon merely abstract autonomy and function\u0026mdash;with their implicit purity and closure\u0026mdash;for plurality and connection. Invention can take many forms. There is moderate: pragmatic living-with-machines that substitutes relational agency for individual autonomy (Latour 1999). Technology still facilitates action. However, if technicity assists almost all action, invention is freed from approximation of normal modalities. Consider Papadimitrou\u0026rsquo;s becoming en-wheeled: \u0026ldquo;a way of being in the world that is not merely mechanical or practical\u0026rdquo; (2008: 695). It may even create entirely new ways of acting (Bach-y-Rita et al. 1969). Or, rather than complementary or supplementary addition to bodies, an aesthetic andexperimental elaboration. Importantly, as we\u0026rsquo;ve seen, individuation also brings with it an associated milieu. So a new technical relation is simultaneously the creation of a new milieu. Of course, this is already happening everywhere. We only need to look for it, and keep bringing it to light.\nWorks Cited # Amundson, R.

This is a work in progress and not for citation.\nThis paper is part of a workshop with Donald A. Landes on his book Merleau-Ponty and the Paradoxes of Expression. It summarises the ideas of Merleau-Ponty, and Landes\u0026rsquo; take on these, before offering some critical comments on Landes\u0026rsquo; chapter on The Structure of Behaviour.\nIntroduction # I\u0026rsquo;m going to begin with a (very) brief summary of some of Merleau-Ponty\u0026rsquo;s ideas, before quickly outlining the concepts around which Landes\u0026rsquo; book is organised. After that, I\u0026rsquo;ll talk about The Structure of Behaviour (hereafter SB), and Landes\u0026rsquo; understanding of it\u0026mdash;that the paradoxical logic of expression is implicit in even this early work\u0026mdash;before offering some comments: first, that a possible tension exists between Merleau-Ponty\u0026rsquo;s abiding emphasis upon perception and Simondon\u0026rsquo;s philosophy, a tension which is not, however, insoluble; and that by also incorporating Simondon\u0026rsquo;s notion of being as problematic, we can further develop an account of bodily behaviour counter to those like Hubert Dreyfus\u0026rsquo;s, that emphasise and valorise the achievement of smooth equilibriums.\nMerleau-Ponty # Merleau-Ponty is best known for his focus upon the perceiving body. This body is neither a passive object, nor a subject only in virtue of a constituting consciousness. Concerning the subject of perception, he replaces \u0026ldquo;consciousness with existence, that is, with being in the world through a body\u0026rdquo; (Merleau-Ponty 2012: 584 n. 23). Perception is involvement in the world through the medium of a body. As fundamentally embodied, it is perspectival. The world eludes full and complete apprehension, and extends beyond spatial and temporal awareness. Hence things appear ambiguous and indeterminate, and solicit \u0026lsquo;completion\u0026rsquo;, as the body is perpetually \u0026lsquo;motivated\u0026rsquo; to maintain a \u0026lsquo;grip\u0026rsquo; on experience. As perception spontaneously and prereflectively \u0026rsquo;traces out\u0026rsquo; objects, so subjects simultaneously \u0026lsquo;find\u0026rsquo; themselves in the world and transform things into that world. Perceiving subject and object perceived are mutually constituted through the mediation of body. Thus, subjects are neither outwith the world, nor within it as a mere thing, but inhabit a world of already meaningful entities that at once transcend them, while speak to us of ourselves\u0026quot;. Throughout, the body is not explicitly cognised, but is an opening onto or \u0026ldquo;point of view on the world\u0026rdquo; (Merleau-Ponty 2012: 73). This world is already apprehended as routes and blockages, tools that are intuitive or obscure, places that are habitable or hostile; that is, meaningfully, as possible ways of relating to and acting in it.\nDonald Landes on Merleau-Ponty # For Merleau-Ponty, bodily expression does not make public a thought that is already fully possessed, whether by indicating (empiricism) or re-presenting it (intellectualism). Rather, words accomplish thought. Only upon expression is a thought realised, and available for understanding. There is no interpretative distance between expression and expressed. Here is something of a paradox: we know what we meant only after expressing it. This brings us to Donald Landes\u0026rsquo; book. As signalled by its title, the work is chiefly concerned with expression and its structure. It suggests that this structure is paradoxical, and that paradox is necessary for and constitutive of expression, and by extension, communication.\nIf expression, then, accomplishes nascent meaning, rather than externalising a determinate internal idea, from what does it emerge? Landes draws upon later Merleau-Ponty to suggest that speech, for example, occurs against a background \u0026lsquo;silence\u0026rsquo;. This is neither \u0026rsquo;nothingness\u0026rsquo; nor \u0026ldquo;the unspoken and preexisting language of thought\u0026rdquo;, but a latent, superabundant reserve both within, and overflowing, the order of manifest expression: \u0026ldquo;the felt presence of so many possibilities that are never made explicit\u0026rdquo; (Landes 2013: 8)\nHere he takes up the work of Gilbert Simondon (2013, 2020). While Simondon is ultimately concerned about human and animal life, and in particular, human relations with technology, he begins with a root-and-branch reform of the concept of the individual. For him, any individual is not self-identical, but exists relative to a dimension he calls preindividual. Individual and preindividual are not discrete substances: they are two moments or movements in an individuating process, that produces individuals. The preindividual describes the reservoir of potential \u0026lsquo;before\u0026rsquo; resolution into an individual, meaning, action, and so on. While logically antecedent, it is neither separate from nor prior to individuals, and is retained throughout individuation as potential for further transformation. It has a particular kind of equilibrium, drawn from thermodynamics: neither stable (which would be exhausted of energy) nor unstable (which would lack any coherence), but metastable: this indicates a precarious organisation where least modification of some parameter is sufficient to provoke transformation. Preindividual being, then, is a supersaturated or tensed system, rich in potential energy, that, unlike the fully-constituted individual, is not self-identical (Simondon 2013).\nSimondon characterises the individuating process as one of \u0026lsquo;dephasing\u0026rsquo;. Strictly speaking, the preindividual is without phase: it is a \u0026ldquo;reservoir of intensities and problems\u0026rdquo; (Landes 2013: 25). Dephasing begins when a tension appears among these intensities, that provokes \u0026ldquo;resolution\u0026hellip; and prolongation of those tensions in the form of a structure (my translation)\u0026rdquo; (Simondon 2013: 25).1 Individuation, then, is the resolution of a tension in the preindividual. The individual is this very resolution: a partial solution of the operation that instigates it. Becoming does not happen to being, but is being\u0026rsquo;s propensity to fall out of phase with itself and in so doing, to resolve itself. Finally, this process is transductive: every individual enters into the preindividual reserve for subsequent individuations. All structures remain metastable, retaining potential to dephase.\nLandes understands expression as an instance of \u0026lsquo;metastable equilibrium\u0026rsquo;. This means that it is \u0026ldquo;precariously stable\u0026rdquo; (Landes 2013, 25): endlessly reconfigured by new expressions that\u0026mdash;paradoxically\u0026mdash;both draw upon and sustain it, take it up in order to surpass it. New expressions contribute their own latent possibilities to the precarious equilibrium. This is the central paradox of expression, ably captured by the term \u0026lsquo;coherent deformation\u0026rsquo;. While a given expression relies upon an established order of signification, both past and present, genuine expression is also creation that surpasses that order, taking up the weight of the past and present in order go beyond them. Poetry works within established language, but by some felicitous redistribution or deployment of a latent possibility, opens up a new trajectory of sense.\nExpression, Landes holds, comprises a \u0026ldquo;trajectory of metastable equilibriums\u0026rdquo; (2013, 85). A new expression neither negates nor replaces a previous one, but prolongs it. This also refers to Jean-Luc Nancy\u0026rsquo;s (1993) notion of exscription, wherein each expression\u0026mdash;in Nancy\u0026rsquo;s terminology, inscription\u0026mdash;simultaneously exscribes all the latent content that overflows it. It prolongs, but also points away from, the latent, still indeterminate trajectories that sustain it. This makes expression inexhaustible in principle, though it may be corralled into less open configurations.\nThe Structure of Behavior # Having said something of how Landes works in general with the ideas of Merleau-Ponty and Simondon, I\u0026rsquo;ll now return to the specific book by Merleau-Ponty that I\u0026rsquo;m discussing today, and also the associated chapter by Landes. Merleau-Ponty developed the theory of perception for which he is best known in Phenomenology of Perception (PhP), and revised this further in later works. However, in the earlier SB, he seeks \u0026ldquo;to understand the relations of consciousness and nature: organic, psychological or even social\u0026rdquo; (1967: 1). This resembles PhP in some respects, and departs from it in others. Like PhP, it seeks an alternative to realism and idealism: it proceeds from behaviour as agnostic in respect of these, so as to define it anew. Unlike PhP, it eschews phenomenological interrogation in favour of philosophical analysis of psychology and physiology. Its principle target is mechanistic behaviourism, which, for Merleau-Ponty, has too hastily expunged certain aspects of behaviour when rejecting Cartesianism. The work aims to reintroduce to behaviour a type of intentionality that is inconceivable in mechanistic terms, without at the same time reinstating intellectualist premises. It not only rejects certain ontological presuppositions of behaviourism\u0026mdash;chiefly, that nature is the sum of external causal events; and that behaviour is explicable via reflex, as a causal reaction to stimuli located in physicochemical properties of an object\u0026mdash;but suggests that these presuppositions are invalidated by behaviourism\u0026rsquo;s own findings.\nMerleau-Ponty\u0026rsquo;s chief conclusion is that biological reactions do not reduce to organismic parts or localised stimuli. Animals do not exist within a world of bare objects that impinge unilaterally and mechanically via objective properties. A stimulus only is a stimulus because the organism inaugurates and projects around it a vital environment, or Umwelt, that \u0026ldquo;gives momentary meaning to all of the local excitations\u0026rdquo; (1967: 14).2 Animals respond to certain aspects of the external situation according to what, for them, makes sense: objects are not encountered as mere things, but relative to vital needs (Barbaras 2004): activity organises around the attractive or repellent, which do not reduce to physicochemical properties. Accordingly, \u0026lsquo;stimuli\u0026rsquo; are not elementary properties, but the arrangement between organism and milieu.\nTo describe this arrangement irreducible to mechanism, Merleau-Ponty offers his own conceptualisation of form. Form is something that exists for active organisms: it does not describe a mere \u0026ldquo;additive whole\u0026rdquo; (Barbaras 2004: 218), but \u0026ldquo;total processes whose properties are not the sum of those which the isolated parts would possess\u0026rdquo; (Merleau-Ponty 1967: 49). For Merleau-Ponty, animal behaviour, while linked to its environment, is also active. Animals are not simply caused to act by their environment (or even by simple internal causal triggers). There is a reciprocal relation of organism and milieu: \u0026ldquo;the creation of certain relations\u0026rdquo; that compose \u0026ldquo;a unity of meaning\u0026rdquo; or signification (1967: 87). The establishment of behaviour, then, is a circular process, a negotation that gives rise to an active and dynamic form, that is \u0026ldquo;the mode of activity proper to the organism\u0026rdquo; (1967: 130). The fact that animals participate in this sense-making process suggests that stimulus cannot be defined independently of organism. An animal, then, has a hand in carving out its perspective on its world, in establishing \u0026ldquo;that part that is adequate to it\u0026rdquo; (1967: 105). Form is a kind of signification instantiated in vital behaviour. This behaviour is part of the organism\u0026rsquo;s reality, which is \u0026ldquo;not substantial but structural\u0026rdquo; (1967: 139).\nMoving to higher behaviour does not entail a new category, only differentiation between \u0026ldquo;degrees of integration\u0026rdquo; (1967: 133). Merleau-Ponty specifies three such Gestalten: physical, vital and human. Physical order describes an equilibrium constituted relative to a external limit, whose activity tends towards rest. These external conditions might be \u0026ldquo;topographical\u0026hellip; as in the distribution of electrical charges on a conductor; or\u0026hellip; conditions which are themselves dynamic, as in the case of a drop of oil placed in the middle of a mass of water\u0026rdquo; (1967: 145). The point here is that activity reaches a limit point at which it is complete, and then ceases. Only with the biological or vital order does behaviour appear. Here, an organism \u0026ldquo;executes a work beyond its proper limits\u0026rdquo;, to actively establish its Umwelt \u0026ldquo;with respect to conditions which are only virtual and which the system itself brings into existence\u0026rdquo; (1967: 145\u0026ndash;46). Before I turn to the third, human, order, it bears mentioning that Merleau-Ponty differentiates within living behavior according to degrees of autonomy. This turns on whether the relevant structure is \u0026ldquo;submerged in the content, or\u0026hellip; emerges from it to become\u0026hellip; the proper theme of activity\u0026rdquo; (1967: 103). In syncretic forms, behaviour is fully submerged in a concrete situation. In amovable forms, behaviours relate to contextual signals, but remain tied to situations that resemble those from which they emerged.\nThe human order adds a \u0026ldquo;third dialectic\u0026rdquo; (Merleau-Ponty 1967: 162): production of new structures. Thanks to symbolic form, behaviour can be liberated both from specific situations and species-defined \u0026lsquo;functional values\u0026rsquo;, to become the \u0026ldquo;proper theme of the activity that tends to express it\u0026rdquo; (1967: 120). Put otherwise, behaviour \u0026ldquo;no longer has only signification, [but] is itself signification\u0026rdquo; (1967: 122). It is available for a plurality of points of view\u0026mdash;different \u0026ldquo;aspects of an identical thing\u0026rdquo; (1967: 116)\u0026mdash;and can take objects as simultaneously available for multiple uses. Put otherwise, human symbolic behaviour introduces a new element: human action takes place, as it were, \u0026lsquo;under a description\u0026rsquo;. The same movement means something different\u0026mdash;is a different act or behaviour\u0026mdash;according to the description or context. Unlike in amovable form, its relationship to situations or meanings is not governed by logics of similitude or resemblance.\nThis also furnishes the existential capacity of \u0026ldquo;orientating oneself in relation to the possible\u0026rdquo; (1967: 176). For Merleau-Ponty, this capacity is what inaugurates the human world proper, and makes possible \u0026ldquo;new cycles of behaviour\u0026rdquo; (which amount to the same thing) (1967: 162). For humans, projects and purposes, and values underpinning these, appear against a structured, human background: \u0026rsquo;nascent perception\u0026rsquo; is of a human milieu. Yet such structures can be thematised, abstracted, given \u0026ldquo;new significance\u0026rdquo;, and finally surpassed (1967: 179). This makes the human dialectic ambiguous (or, paradoxical): the selfsame activity that engenders what apparently determinate structures has \u0026ldquo;as its meaning to reject them and to surpass them\u0026rdquo; (1967: 176).\nLandes on Merleau-Ponty and Simondon # Landes finds a paradoxical logic implicit in even this early work. Merleau-Ponty\u0026rsquo;s critique of reflex reveals a form of paradoxical, \u0026ldquo;directed activity between blind mechanism and intelligent behaviour\u0026rdquo; (Landes 2013: 64). Even basic, animal behaviours are orientated according to \u0026ldquo;current positions and potential movements\u0026rdquo;, addressed to a future situation that is not yet actual (2013: 64): what Landes calls, in his language of expression, a \u0026ldquo;future paradoxical ideal weight\u0026rdquo; (2013: 64). Even simple behaviour, then, \u0026ldquo;is expression\u0026rdquo; (2013: 60): activity wherein an interior expresses itself on the outside, where the interior does not preexist, but is produced though, the expression.\nSimilarly, more complex behaviours \u0026ldquo;respond to the situation by playing forward a past that is thereby paradoxically altered\u0026rdquo; (2013: 66). Bodily behaviour and gesture has its own kind of intelligence or \u0026ldquo;expressive creativity\u0026rdquo; (2013: 64): it is a \u0026ldquo;moving expression of its past and present towards a future that is present as metastable\u0026rdquo; (2013: 64). Landes suggests that nascent perception is already paradoxical, or ambiguous, as always self-transcending towards the \u0026lsquo;virtual\u0026rsquo;. The form or sense that grounds activity, then, is not only taken up but transformed: every activity \u0026ldquo;instates new lines of force\u0026rdquo; in an existing field. This makes the human situation dynamic: activity is \u0026ldquo;creation in the face of an evolving situation\u0026rdquo;, orientated in virtue of \u0026ldquo;unpredictable future encounters\u0026rdquo; (2013: 72).\nResponse (1): From Form to Information # While recognising that Landes claims only that Merleau-Ponty tends towards the kind of equilibrium Simondon will eventually describe, a cursory response to this encounter might still wonder whether a tension exists between their respective positions of these two with respect to perception and sense. For Merleau-Ponty, bodily experience is founded in perception. This commitment to perceptual primacy obtains throughout his work: there is always presupposition of, and grounding in, primordial perceptual sense. In SB, form plays this role. In Simondon\u0026rsquo;s problematic, however, the preindividual is an ontogenetic operation that exists, as it were, one stage earlier. The preindividual cannot correlate with perception or, crucially, any notion of sense. It is by definition prior to the individual, whereas sense, however indeterminate or paradoxical, is a relation between individual and milieu that is, to a greater or lesser extent, already individuated.\nLandes combines Merleau-Ponty and Simondon to develop a robust notion of the potential for transformation that resides in the order of expression. A body draws upon something latent within past and present, in order to create a future difference. Landes calls bodily movement a \u0026ldquo;paradoxical response\u0026rdquo;, insofar as it plays forward the past and present towards \u0026ldquo;a new situation, something that comes from an alternatively-configured one that shares neither its content nor its material form, but its sense\u0026rdquo; (2013: 64). I wonder whether conceiving this operation in terms of shared sense might not inhibit creative expressive potential, even if this is not fully grasped until the gesture is completed. A tension exists, then, between Merleau-Ponty\u0026rsquo;s position, where form is the \u0026ldquo;ultimate ground\u0026rdquo;, and Simondon\u0026rsquo;s, where the foundation resides in the movement, still incommensurable with sense, out of which sense emerges (2013: 68). This risks turning form into something that exists prior to, and then undergoes, transformation, rather than something that is, as it were, composed of transformations. Is metastability the metastable of the expressed, or does what is expressed express the metastable? I offer this tension as a topic for discussion. However, a potential response might be to bolster the processual dimension of sense, by supplanting the priority of form with the process of taking-form: the movement from preindividual towards sense, that Simondon calls information. This is the \u0026ldquo;formula of individuation\u0026rdquo; that regulates how, in this case, sense, will emerge, but does not preexist this operation, and is gradually elaborated through the transductive process of individuation (Simondon 2013: 31).3\nResponse (2): From Equilibria to Problems # We could build this out further by recalling Simondon\u0026rsquo;s assertion that being is inherently problematic (2013). As noted, a problem emerges when a burgeoning tension within the preindividual reservoir of some domain leads to dephasing. This dephasing is the elaboration of the problem; the individual, by individuating itself, resolves the tension. Returning to bodily behaviour, this could be understood as a problem of varying orientation within a diverse world that ceaselessly insists in ways that are only partially predictable, and that solicits expressive responses.\nGiving centrality to problems in expressive bodily behaviour allows us to avoid a tendency to overemphasise minimisation or even elimination of tension. This tendency is epitomised by Hubert Dreyfus\u0026rsquo; notion of \u0026lsquo;skilful coping\u0026rsquo; (Dreyfus 2013; Dreyfus and Dreyfus 1999). Dreyfus claims that in learning, agents gradually surpass general rules from which learning begins, to eventually respond spontaneously, non-reflectively, but intelligently to the situation in question. Dreyfus suggests that this entire process is geared towards the maintainence of what Merleau-Ponty calls \u0026lsquo;optimal grip\u0026rsquo;: an ongoing and implicit reorientation of the perceiving body, to discern objects adequately relative to current concerns. For Dreyfus, coping is not merely an important aspect of, or even structure within, embodied experience. It is strongly normative: we are at our most human when coping, which is intelligent but spontaneous smoothing over tensions in activity (Reynolds 2006).\nAs we have seen, SB already has a different, arguably more nuanced, account than the one outlined by Dreyfus (moreover, Gayle Salamon (2012) demonstrates convincingly that Dreyfus distorts optimal grip to fit with his own idea of coping, and that Merleau-Ponty makes no such strong claims about the direction and ultimate seamlessness of embodied activity). For Merleau-Ponty, overcoming structures and creating new ones is what is characteristically human. And, this precisely involves thematisation of, and not immersion in, a behavioural context. Indeed, skillful coping might be considered closer to what Merleau-Ponty would consider amovable, or even syncretic, behavior, insofar as it is correlated tightly with a context. While in SB human behaviour shuttles between degrees of integration, only creatively surpassing structure expresses properly human activity. Landes, by enjoining Simondon to suggest that behaviour is a moving trajectory of metastable equilibriums, strengthens this reading. For Simondon, problems or paradoxes are centrally implicated in the emergence of the new. They indicate that something cannot be straightforwardly absorbed into the existing state of affairs, and that it demands a creative response. Behaviour is a continual tension and release. A spontaneous grip on the world, that inaugurates and maintains a bodily form or sense, occurs alongside the creative inauguration and resolution of problems as the body moves through more or less familiar situations. The crucial difference is this: for Dreyfus elimination of tension is a telos. Jack Reynold rightly suggests that denies problems and tensions them their \u0026ldquo;incendiary power\u0026rdquo; (2006: 533). Problems and paradoxes, however, introduce something irreducible to the current equilibrium: something that can surpass it towards the future. Problems are not something accidental or undesirable that some individual must solve to restore a stable equilibrium. Building from Landes\u0026rsquo; reading of the metastability of behaviour, we can suggest that formation of and response to problems\u0026mdash;and the concomitant creative instigation of merely metastable equilibriums of sense\u0026mdash;is a foundational aspect of expressive bodily being.\nWorks Cited # Barbaras, R.

It discusses impairment in relation to normal function, including its identification as deviation from normal health. It then draws upon phenomenological concepts to develop an alternate account of embodiment, as always already dependent upon relations with things outside itself. It posits that \u0026rsquo;normal ability\u0026rsquo; is consequently a socio-historical elaboration rather than an objectively existing state of affairs, and that the accompanying prioritisation of some modes of embodiment over others creates the phenomenon called disability. Finally, it outlines an alternative framework that eschews reference to transcendent norms for grounding in capacities and goals, however atypical, of embodied agents.\n1.1. Medical and Social Theories of Disability and Impairment # The meaning of disability is commonly take as settled. It is a personal problem occasioned by a dysfunctional body or property thereof. This \u0026lsquo;medical model\u0026rsquo; broadly asserts the following (by degrees). (1) Identity obtains between disability and abnormal individual morphology. (2) This morphology fails to realise normal human function. (3) Disabilities directly cause negative outcomes or health decrements. (4) Consequently, disabilities warrant correction or rehabilitation, which the disabled person should aﬃrm.\nConsider Christopher Boorse\u0026rsquo;s influential species typical function (Boorse 1977, 1997, 2014). Here, health equals conformity with species typical function. This is specified as statistically normal function or design of some \u0026lsquo;reference class\u0026rsquo; (species members of similar age and sex). For Boorse, \u0026ldquo;the normal is the natural\u0026rdquo; (1977, 554): natural equals species typical design. Normalcy is an objective biological fact, verified statistically for a particular class. This \u0026rsquo;empirical ideal\u0026rsquo; grounds health judgements. Health is conformity with this ideal; disease deviates from it. Impairment, as deviation from normal function, is pathological, and so is essentially a reduction of health.\nTheorists advancing a \u0026lsquo;social model of disability\u0026rsquo; dispute that impairment is the preeminent cause of many limitations. Medical definitions do not merely report natural states of affairs, but also ascribe negative meanings to impairments, that acquire the status of \u0026ldquo;objective fact and common sense\u0026rdquo; (Kafer 2013: 5). They criticise the medical model for considering disability largely objective, knowable and constant, overlooking not only how properties change, but how experience thereof varies by culture or environment. Minimal attention is paid to other life-affecting circumstances. They suggest that the medical framework itself produces deleterious outcomes. Its pervasive influence may engender a \u0026ldquo;fallacy of composition\u0026hellip; where a false conclusion is drawn about the whole person based on features of her constituent parts\u0026rdquo; (Smith 2009: 20–21). That disability is considered individual, a \u0026ldquo;personal tragedy\u0026rdquo; to be \u0026ldquo;treated, prevented or cured\u0026rdquo;, renders disabled people fundamentally unlike, even lesser than, a nondisabled majority (Oliver and Barnes 2012: 20). Removing disadvantage means overcoming disability through cure or personal fortitude. Social participation correlates to approximation of normalcy. Finally, where disability is considered the foremost or total cause of disadvantage, other causes are occluded and alternate responses precluded.\nSocial modellists reject that disability is immanent to the body. They disambiguate causes into two kinds\u0026mdash;biological and social\u0026mdash;with corresponding outcomes. Impairment describes mere objective morphological facts, and attendant limitations. Disability describes socially-instantiated discrimination flowing from negative evaluations about impairment; evaluations based in hierarchical divisions between normalcy and deviance whose origin is at least partially medical. Impairment becomes disability on meeting discrimination or an unsupportive environment. Impairment means one cannot walk. Disability occurs where buildings are inaccessible.\n1.2. Some Problems of the Social Model # The social model is laudable for disclosing aspects of disability not entailed by impairment. Yet certain aspects warrant criticism: chiefly, the impairment/disability distinction. This objectifies the body as a brute thing separate from and prior to social experience. First, this upholds persistent dualisms that render the body inert, atemporal and ahistorical: either a clump of inert stuff or mechanistically produced. It is reduced to what phenomenology calls an objective body (Merleau-Ponty 2012): \u0026ldquo;devoid of meaning, a dysfunctional, anatomical, corporeal mass obdurate in its resistance to signification and phenomenologically dead, without intentionality or agency\u0026rdquo; (Hughes and Paterson 1997, 329). Lived or agential aspects are transferred to separate social or mental domains.\nSecond, while disabling social responses to impairment are criticised, the category itself remains unaddressed. Social modellists claim that the medical model falsely overestimates limitations flowing from impairment properties, and rejoins that some, though not all, are spurious. This maintains, and also naturalises, the existing bifurcation into normal and abnormal embodiment. Impairment remains a problematic deviation outside the normal scope of embodiment. Interestingly, Boorse considers his work compatible with disability theory that admits impairment\u0026rsquo;s objective pathology, while well-known disability theorist Tom Shakespeare (2014) aﬃrms Boorse\u0026rsquo;s disease concept. For medicine and social model alike impairment equals natural abnormality. Relatedly, this impedes recognition that impairment\u0026rsquo;s provenance may itself be partially socio-historical and evaluative. This is apparent in contestations over definition: entities designated impairments vary by time and place. More profound still are Susan Wendell\u0026rsquo;s questions (1996), which inform what follows: how far must one walk to not be disabled? Do contextual variations not contribute?\n2.1. Merleau-Ponty and Active Perception # It bears consideration whether any strict division between normalcy and impairment is tenable, and whether the body is separate from social experience. Accordingly, I will outline a phenomenologically informed account of embodied subjectivity, before addressing the salience of what we might call \u0026rsquo;technicity\u0026rsquo;. An enduring story about human experience supposes that perception and action serve knowledge; and, that objective body serves subjective mind, which is the locus of consciousness and knowledge. This is consistent with what Susan Hurley (2010) calls the \u0026rsquo;traditional sandwich model\u0026rsquo; of mind and body. The body inputs sensation; then the \u0026lsquo;heavy lifting\u0026rsquo; occurs within the brain qua mind as this is organised into knowledge via representation; then finally, this is returned to the world as bodily action. Maurice Merleau-Ponty\u0026rsquo;s phenomenology rejects such definitive distinction between consciousness and embodiment. For him the body is no inert ventriloquist\u0026rsquo;s dummy requiring animation. It is an \u0026lsquo;organ\u0026rsquo; of movement and connection, one\u0026rsquo;s very openness to the world. As embodied, as having a particular perceptual structure, and as immersed within the world, it necessarily and immediately has a perspective or comportment. Its world is prereflectively encountered as meaningful situations\u0026mdash;where that meaning is structured by past and present interests\u0026mdash;and as eliciting responses. Accordingly, the world appears not as Cartesian extensa wherein objects are disinterestedly arrayed and await meaning, but as already charged with sense. \u0026lsquo;Sense\u0026rsquo; here connotes something like the French sens: at once meaning and direction. Likewise, the body is not typically experienced as an object, however intimate, but a power of acting towards situations. One does not have, but is, a body that is a \u0026ldquo;knot of living significations\u0026rdquo; (Merleau-Ponty 2012: 153). So, in familiar activity, body and world are not given as discrete terms\u0026mdash;subject standing over against object\u0026mdash;but as prereflective involvement in proximal activity. Knowledge serves activity. Indeed, perception is a kind of incipient action: to grasp the world is to prepare action in response to its solicitations. Consequently, the embodied self is not a substantive. Wherever encountered, it is always disposed, in motion, which is inauguration of sense.\n2.2. Sociality and Technicity # I have so far suggested that the body\u0026rsquo;s \u0026rsquo;essence\u0026rsquo; is to act towards situational possibilities, which concurrently inaugurates sense. This can be further developed. The human is traditionally considered bounded, self-identical and enduring, with determinate functions that exist in advance of activities. On one picture, to be human is to by the rational legislator of oneself: a conscious subject whose essence is not found it is body, who owns its body and uses it to realise its consciously-formulated ends (cf. with Hurley\u0026rsquo;s account above). Everything essential to the human is found in its mind; nothing outside that is essentially human. There is an essence of the human that transcends and endures through changes in its surroundings. Of course, we can propose a different ontology of the human and its embodiment: as something that exists or constitutes itself through its activities, and that is \u0026lsquo;always already enhanced\u0026rsquo; through profound incorporation within such activity of extra-organismic materials. Various philosophers call this condition \u0026lsquo;originary technicity\u0026rsquo;. Technics here does not refer to specific technological objects, but to a constitutive relation of embodied activity with things outside it. And, technology captures the whole gamut of things that allow the development of an associated technique, and thereby modifies and extends what the human can do, and what it is. The human is what it is because of its technological relations. This implies that the human is constituted through creative engagement with things, and that its continued realisation likewise relies upon such relations.\nTwo interconnected phenomenological aspects are salient: one pragmatic, the other developmental. First, myriad prostheses, broadly construed, are incorporated within activities more usually limited to mind and body. For Merleau-Ponty (2012), the lived body does not terminate at the dermal boundary. He considers the nonsighted man whose integration of cane and bodily intentionality becomes sufficiently profound that the cane is incorporated within his perceptual integrity as he negotiates situational space. It is no longer an external mediating object, but one \u0026ldquo;sensitive zone\u0026rdquo; among multiple \u0026lsquo;organs\u0026rsquo; that together give him his world (2012, 144). Likewise, experienced wheelchair-users traverse space using sensorimotor knowledge in which their chair is absorbed within this \u0026ldquo;global awareness of\u0026hellip; posture in the inter-sensory world\u0026rdquo; (2012: 102).1 This is possible due to involvement within world-directed projects. Not only do thought and action overspill embodiment. They emerge from, and supervene upon, processual interactions between brain, body and world: they are enacted in \u0026ldquo;dynamic interactions between organisms and environments\u0026rdquo; (Protevi 2014: 127).\nSecond, prosthetics are profoundly interwoven within the development of the human. For Joanna Zylinska (2010, 156) the human is \u0026ldquo;always already prosthetic, whereby relationality and dependence on \u0026rsquo;the outside\u0026rsquo; are the condition of emergence and existence in the world\u0026rdquo;. This reliance upon self-exteriorisation, composition and assemblage suggests a radical bodily openness. Humans do not merely interact with external things, while remaining essentially unchanged: in transforming technology, they are transformed. A fundamental aspect of human existence has been, and continues to be, meaningful and active negotiation of human-nonhuman boundaries. The history of hominisation is one of co-evolution with tools and prosthetics (Leroi-Gourhan 1993): \u0026ldquo;a long line of technical prostheses such as flint stones and other \u0026lsquo;memory devices\u0026rsquo; that have played an active role in the very process of the constitution of the human\u0026rdquo; (Zylinska 2010: 157). This constitution remains essentially incomplete.\nAll bodies are mixed. The human\u0026mdash;individual humans, and the human as an \u0026rsquo;entity\u0026rsquo;\u0026mdash;is not self-identical but produced through its associations. This has implications for biological-social relations. Recall the phenomenological insight that milieus are disclosed not only according to morphology, but also accumulated experience expressed as habit or comportment. So, worldly possibilities are disclosed as an indivisible compound with organismic and social aspects. There is no pure organism separate from social and technical relations, since comportment is enabled and acquired within a world of already meaningful, historically elaborating assemblages.\n2.3. A Biosocial Account of Impairment # I will now consider implications for impairment. This concerns its status as a supposedly natural dysfunction, rather than socially instantiated disability. My point is that impairment is no more natural than disability. Impairment arises due to the historically elaborated disvalue attached to atypical morphology.\nFirst, contexts delimit in advance which activities are available, and thus which have been assigned value. While a certain body may be unable to realise activities in a given milieu, many purportedly spontaneous and natural objectives and situations are contingent outcomes of the aforementioned harmonisation of bodies and space, that has prioritised a delimited range of morphologies. This grants to typical bodies their apparently natural function. Yet since situations and activities are produced and contingent, so are associated functional norms. There is no essential human function that transcends contexts. Context-transcendent ability would imply some kind of originary, self-sufficient, complete human, as though in the state of nature. As Bernard Stiegler writes, this condition would represent \u0026ldquo;the absence of relation\u0026rdquo; (Stiegler 1998: 128). There is no universally valid\u0026mdash;that is, \u0026rsquo;normal\u0026rsquo;\u0026mdash;mode, but normalised relations that prioritise certain modes.\nPut differently, \u0026lsquo;ability\u0026rsquo; is not preexistent but realised in situational activity.2 This makes occurrence not merely spatial but temporal. Disability and ability exist as they happen, according to the activity at hand and norms concerning valued activity. There is no ability or disability antecedent of situation, only enabling and disabling relations. \u0026lsquo;Ability\u0026rsquo; is less a matter of innate features, and more of temporally-normalised relations between bodies and a world of \u0026lsquo;assistive devices\u0026rsquo; that en-able them. The seeming complementarity between \u0026rsquo;normal\u0026rsquo; humans and environments is not spontaneous, but the outcome of activities, both historical and contemporary, that render the world thus according to a privileged corporeal ideal. Conversely, disability qua impairment is neither reducible to physical properties, nor inherent lack.3 It occurs where supports are absent, or ill-fitting for merely atypical bodies: where an orientated body encounters others with incongruent orientations, or spaces with inapt affordances. The \u0026rsquo;normal body\u0026rsquo; it is implicitly given at one pole of the body-world circuit, instantiated within milieus of various kinds. One attempts \u0026rsquo;normal\u0026rsquo; possibilities because these are habitually given as \u0026lsquo;what one does\u0026rsquo;, and because contexts advert to such affordances. So, environments solicit unrealisable possibilities: however effectively the non-visual person or wheelchair-user comports themselves, they inhabit an environment designed for motility other than theirs.\nThough partially instantiated in architecture, cultural products, policy prescriptions, and so on, disability is relational: it is only activated to the extent that these encounter bodies. In this biosocial notion of humanity, categorisations are non-trivial, and affect distribution of resources for activity. Thus, some enjoy affordances while others are denied. It is not intrinsic to an atypical body that it cannot act in a milieu; a historically elaborated milieu only accommodates typical bodies. This does not deny that ability has degrees, only that it is specifiable independent of context and activity. And, it may be enacted differently\u0026mdash;aided, or inhibited\u0026mdash;by different environments.\n3.1. The Problem of Limits: Impairment and The Human # So, the development of the human has centrally involved production and negotiation of limits, including boundaries between itself and what lies outside it, where this outside has also involved anomalous embodiment. Some such limits are materially embedded: genetic endowments (prioritisation of certain genotypes during prenatal testing), or spatial organisation (inaccessible architecture). Others are epistemic: ways of seeing, thinking and acting incarnated as habit or \u0026ldquo;maintained in textual, technological, institutional procedures or cultural practices\u0026rdquo;. (Gallagher 2013: 7) They might be recognised as contingent and somewhat negotiable. While variable in extent\u0026mdash;behaviour is more readily modified than morphology\u0026mdash;none are truly transcendent, a priori categories. This does not make them arbitrary. They determine in advance what is thinkable or doable (Foucault 2012). This characteristic is not inherently negative, since limits are conditions of possibility: they also enable. Every action reckons within possibilities organised by contextual limits (and implicitly, those limits themselves) (Merleau-Ponty 2012).\nUnder this aspect, limits are necessary but transformable conditions. Under another, they seem fixed and insuperable. Such is the case when some state of affairs is naturalised as an enduring object, its constitutive processes elided. This occurs routinely with the human. Manifold reasons exist to question the universality of generic humanity with normal form and function. The human emerges relationally: its apparent harmony within the world is not, strictly speaking, spontaneous, but the product of co-evolving processes. However, only the outcomes of such activities are typically endorsed as real. Developmental processes are taken as secondary, or even ignored. This takes the product for producer: it places the \u0026lsquo;ideal human\u0026rsquo; prior and external to the circumstances of its elaboration. Its purportedly determinate form and function become transcendent norms constraining bodies and modes of being within a grid of pre-given possibilities. Limit becomes a limitation upon variety, while the body\u0026rsquo;s fundamental and constitutive indetermination is obscured.\nThere are related implications for freedom and dependence. As I alluded to earlier, at least since modern thought, the human person has been considered an individual cognising agent, having certain essential attributes, and free\u0026mdash;at least in principle\u0026mdash;from constraint. Rational, individual autonomy is paramount among such attributes. The body, while partially determined, labours to realise this freedom (Esposito 2015). This becomes another norm transcending life (Campbell 2008). Thus, tool use by nondisabled people appears to merely extend a preexisting and indwelling freedom or ability. Prosthetic use by a putatively impaired person, however, is called assistive; here, the tools are thought to be the sources of freedom or ability, or to compensate for the absence of these capacities. This distinction is specious: it elides how \u0026rsquo;nondisabled autonomy\u0026rsquo; is likewise dependent upon, and enabled by, constitutive technological associations.\n3.2. Limits on the Future # Why this production of oppositional limits within the heterogeneity of bodies? Foucault famously cites rationalising Enlightenment goals of organised knowledge and administered bodies. Where bodily anomaly was hitherto comprehended through myth or religion, medicine now performs this role. However, he and others note that its relatively simple dichotomies have succumbed to more granular and mobile operations called biopolitics (Deleuze 1992; Esposito 2008; Foucault 1978). These practices address biological capacities and health conditions as political problems. They seek to \u0026ldquo;optimise, and multiply [life by] subjecting it to precise controls and comprehensive regulations\u0026rdquo;, by targeting perturbations in phenomena that manifest at the population level: \u0026ldquo;birth, and mortality\u0026hellip; health, life expectancy\u0026rdquo; (Foucault 1978: 137, 139). The most salient aspect of these processes\u0026mdash;processes that Catherine Mills calls a politicisation and \u0026ldquo;intensification of biological difference\u0026rdquo; (Mills 2011: 25)\u0026mdash;is the aim to \u0026ldquo;improve life by eliminating accidents, the random element, and deficiencies\u0026rdquo; (Foucault 2005: 248). That is, biopolitics involves an attempt to master and control the human present, and especially future, by rendering these \u0026ldquo;regular, predictable, knowable\u0026rdquo; (Grosz 2004: 111). Keith Ansell-Pearson and Babette Babich both describe such goals as utopian. Instead of life \u0026ldquo;as it is, with all its trouble and mess\u0026rdquo; (Babich 2017, 123), these crave life extirpated of all suffering and adversity (Ansell-Pearson 1997). Imagining the possibility of a future purged of disorder, these seek to delimit its outlines in advance.\nThis is of utmost importance for anomalous embodiment, which affronts not merely by involving \u0026lsquo;hardship\u0026rsquo;, but due to its unpredictability and unboundedness. It appears to warrant normalisation by exceeding \u0026ldquo;predictable narratives\u0026rdquo; (Garland-Thomson 2012, 351). In one prevailing imagined future\u0026mdash;called by Alison Kafer a \u0026lsquo;curative imaginary\u0026rsquo;\u0026mdash;atypical bodies have no place: this \u0026ldquo;understanding of disability\u0026hellip; not only expects intervention but also cannot imagine\u0026hellip; anything other than intervention\u0026rdquo; (Kafer 2013: 27). This medicalised temporality cannot conceive a future not governed by present ideals of human perfection. Impairment rehabilitated or cured confirms progress; as un-cured, it either falls outside or impedes it. This is especially apparent in bioethical endorsement of practices like prenatal testing, which take as axiomatic that \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rdquo; want children who are \u0026ldquo;longer-lived, stronger, happier, smarter, fairer\u0026rdquo; (Harris 2010: 8). For methodologically individualist ethicists like John Harris, this involves prevention of inverse attributes, which for him include atypical properties. Thus these appear as failure to properly realise an ideal future. Such imagined futures do not merely reveal present ideals, but loop back in turn to condition the present. For example, the majority of women in developed countries choose abortion following a Down syndrome diagnosis (Mills 2014).\nConcluding Remarks # With all of this in mind, can there be any justified ethical assent towards biomedical strategies, given that these will most likely prolong normalisation, and implicitly endorse a biopolitical future? Arguably yes, so long as this is accompanied by conceptual work to disclose presuppositions and explore alternatives. I do not argue for or against particular procedures, but am concerned where certain outcomes seem obvious, or are taken for granted. I am sceptical of practices that proceed from abstract types rather than concrete embodiments; from individual autonomy rather than interdependence; and especially, claims based in restoration of full humanity. While not every mode of living is equivalent\u0026mdash;some things are experienced as obstacles; bodies do incur restrictions\u0026mdash;I reject ideal form or function for the absolute singularity of bodies, and multiple and diverse modes of living.\nI finish with several gestures towards a more open account. First, anomaly has nothing essentially to do with health. Catherine Mills notes that for Georges Canguilhem, species typicality illicitly conflates two kinds of norm. Anomaly is synchronic, describing similitude and difference among diverse bodies. Its norms are statistical. Pathology is diachronic, describing temporal modification of life course: how conducive states of affairs are with subjective goals. Its norms are therapeutic and evaluative. Anomaly, as statistical deviation, is not abnormality qua pathology, which involves \u0026ldquo;direct and concrete feeling of suffering and impotence, the feeling of life gone wrong\u0026rdquo; (Canguilhem 1991: 129). For Canguilhem, health involves capacity to respond to milieus. Crucially, this is not relative to an absolute ideal\u0026mdash;for him no such type exists\u0026mdash;but previous states of that life. A bodily state can only be evaluated\u0026mdash;can only be normal\u0026mdash;relative to milieu and life trajectory. If anomaly does not perturb life activity, it is normal, not pathological, for that person. This might also comport with Merleau-Ponty\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;optimal grip\u0026rsquo; (2012): an adequate relation to desired outcomes in some context. This norm of optimality could be considered as relative neither to other bodies nor an abstract ideal, but to realising conditions that, however atypical, avail of one\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;flourishing\u0026rsquo;. This can be fruitfully coupled with Anita Silvers differentiation between functional level and mode: \u0026ldquo;mode is the manner in which a functional outcome is achieved\u0026hellip; level is the quantitative degree of the functional performance, such as speed or the strength\u0026rdquo; (Amundson 2000, 36). For \u0026rsquo;normal function\u0026rsquo; advocates it is better to approximate normal mode than to function well, precluding \u0026ldquo;anomalous but effectively adaptive alternative modes\u0026rdquo; (Silvers 1998: 104). However, if normal function is abandoned, high functional levels are realisable for \u0026ldquo;very atypical people\u0026rdquo; using \u0026ldquo;atypical modes of functioning\u0026rdquo; (Amundson 2000: 48).\nSecond, autonomy criteria require modification. Humans are constitutively conditional upon myriad prosthetics. Instead of a binary between normal bodies with (potentially) unlimited freedom of activity, and abnormal bodies whose activity is intrinsically limited, there are heterogeneous bodies within contexts that partially enable them. I reject dichotomisation between dependency and autonomy for a concept of enablement. This captures interrelation between each aspect of activity, addressing the role of context (enabled by) alongside realisation of action (enabled to). A simultaneously richer and more modest autonomy should relinquish the will to individual self-mastery, for a relational form that encompasses and affirms connections with other bodies and technologies.\nFinally, there is the future. That humanity is malleable and emerges with situation does not dissolve it outright\u0026mdash;it is a profound horizon for life\u0026mdash;but implies that its outlines are not unchangeable. Burgeoning biotechnological developments will transform capacities in ways that overspill all extant humans, engendering new, yet-inconceivable, entanglements and enablements. There is no principled reason to differentiate between biotechnical, or medical and social, interventions. Rejection of a normalcy criterion means that proposed interventions need not replicate existing functions. They are only limited by what can be imagined. And, imagining different futures might also allow us to differently imagine, and create, the present.\nWorks Cited # Amundson, R.
