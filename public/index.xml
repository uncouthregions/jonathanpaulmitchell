      <description>I was an Irish Research Council Government of Ireland Postgraduate Scholar in the School of Philosophy at University College Dublin.
My research falls within the tradition of critical disability studies, and also draws upon feminist philosophy, twentieth-century continental philosophy, philosophy of biology, and philosophy of technology. It examines the relationship between disability and the human, and the role played by disability in practices that stabilise ideas of what is properly or essentially human.</description>

Disability is a consistent topic of concern within philosophical ethics (including medical and applied ethics, and bioethics). In many cases, however, it is viewed solely as an individual misfortune, and an impediment to well-being. This is because matters of the good human life turn on some criterion—rational autonomy, say, or personhood—that distinguishes good from bad lives.</description>

      <title>Disability and The Inhuman</title>

      <description>Presented at ‘The Inhuman Gaze and Perceiving Otherwise’, Centre Culturel Irlandais, Paris, France, 6-9 June 2018. This is a work in progress and not for citation.
A final version of this paper is published as “Disability and the Inhuman”, in Perception and the Inhuman Gaze: Perspectives from Philosophy, Phenomenology and the Sciences, edited by Anya Daly, James Jardine, Fred Cummins, and Dermot Moran, 298-307. London: Routledge, 2020.
When presented with the term &amp;lsquo;inhuman&amp;rsquo;, I was drawn to consider how certain ways of existing become associated with the inhuman; how such associations are involved in the constitution of what is taken as properly human; and finally, the deleterious effects for those who, because they move or thing in unconventional ways, become associated with the inhuman.</description>

      <title>Repealing the 8th Amendment need not erode disability rights</title>
      <link>https://jonathanpaulmitchell.com/post/8th-amendment-disability-rights/</link>

      <description>In their arguments against repeal of the 8th Amendment of the Irish Constitution, the No campaign has used Down syndrome to suggest that this Amendment is necessary to protect disability rights. It isn’t.
First, the Love Both campaign website notes that government proposals contain no explicit ban upon abortion on grounds of disability diagnosis. It infers from this that “babies with disabilities” and “babies with Down syndrome” are placed at “serious risk” (I won’t say much about this rhetorical strategy that conflates foetus with baby or child besides noting that a foetus is neither, and that you can read more about that here).</description>

The main content of this paper is published as “Unsafe Ground: Technology, Habit, and the Enactment of Disability”. Women, Gender &amp;amp; Research 31, no. 2 (2021): 24–39.
In this paper, I talk about very basic kinds of technology, and how these contribute to the enaction of disability.</description>

Introduction This paper largely concerns grounding concepts that inform medical and social theories of impairment. It discusses impairment in relation to normal function, including its identification as deviation from normal health. It then draws upon phenomenological concepts to develop an alternate account of embodiment, as always already dependent upon relations with things outside itself.</description>

      <description>Presented at Nordic Network Gender Body Health conference &amp;lsquo;Disability, Arts and Health&amp;rsquo;, Bergen University, Bergen, 1-2 September 2016.

Introduction Technologies are not mere external utilities, but are profoundly involved within human development. Explanation of such involvement takes various forms. Like natural and social artefacts, technologies have a historical development, and can acquire metaphysical baggage (Hui 2016). One way to conceptualise technology is in terms of prosthesis: a tool&amp;mdash;from a flint or a hammer, to language&amp;mdash;that extends or enables capacities.</description>
