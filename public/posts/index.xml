      <description>Disability is a consistent topic of concern within philosophical ethics (including medical and applied ethics, and bioethics). In many cases, however, it is viewed as a misfortune, and an impediment to well-being. This is because matters of the good human life turn on some criterion—rational autonomy, say, or personhood—that distinguishes good from bad lives. These specify certain properties or capacities that are purported to be essential to humans, and for a good life.</description>

      <description>Presented at ‘The Inhuman Gaze and Perceiving Otherwise’, Centre Culturel Irlandais, Paris, France, 6-9 June 2018. This is a work in progress and not for citation.
When presented with the term ‘inhuman’, I was drawn to consider how certain ways of being become associated with the inhuman, how this association is involved in the constitution of what is taken as properly human, and the deleterious effects for those who become associated with the inhuman.</description>

      <title>Repealing the 8th Amendment need not erode disability rights</title>

      <description>In their arguments against repeal of the 8th Amendment of the Irish Constitution, the No campaign has used Down syndrome to suggest that this Amendment is necessary to protect disability rights. It isn’t.
First, the Love Both campaign website notes that government proposals contain no explicit ban upon abortion on grounds of disability diagnosis. It infers from this that “babies with disabilities” and “babies with Down syndrome” are placed at “serious risk” (I won’t say much about this rhetorical strategy that conflates foetus with baby or child besides noting that a foetus is neither, and that you can read more about that here).</description>

      <description>Presented at the Nordic Network Gender Body Health workshop ‘Interrogating Prostheses’, Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden, 15-16 May 2017. This is a work in progress and not for citation.
In this paper, I talk about very basic kinds of technology, and how these contribute to the enaction of disability. I first sketch some commonplaces concerning the body and technology, before outlining my own position on these: that the body has a fundamental relationality, of which technology comprises an aspect.</description>

      <description>Presented at ‘Workshop with Donald A. Landes on Merleau-Ponty and the Paradoxes of Expression’, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland, 18 May 2016. This is a work in progress and not for citation.
This paper is part of a workshop with Donald A. Landes on his book Merleau-Ponty and the Paradoxes of Expression. It summarises the ideas of Merleau-Ponty, and Landes’ take on these, before offering some critical comments on Landes’ chapter on ‘The Structure of Behaviour’.</description>

      <title>Atypical Morphology and the Normative Limits of Ability and Function</title>

      <description>Presented at ‘Theorizing the Body in Health and Medicine’, Maastricht University, Maastricht, Netherlands, 25-26 November 2015. Not for citation.
This paper largely concerns grounding concepts that inform medical and social theories of impairment. It discusses impairment in relation to normal function, including its identification as a deviation from normal health. It then draws upon phenomenological concepts to develop an alternate account of embodiment, as always already dependent upon relations with things outside itself.</description>
